> **I want to** configure extension parameters for task definitions,
> **so that** domain-specific business logic and custom attributes can be applied to task creation workflows.


**Key Capabilities:**

> 1. Administrator defines a new task definition with required core identifiers including unique definition ID, task name, and associated entity type.
> 2. Administrator configures task validity period by specifying effective date and optional expiration date to control when the task definition is active.
> 3. Administrator sets default operational parameters including preferred queue assignment, priority level with read-only restrictions, and descriptive text.
> 4. Administrator configures extension parameters through OpenL rules that define custom attributes and their data types for domain-specific requirements.
> 5. Administrator establishes flexible date configuration options for task instances:
>    5.1 When warning date delay is not predefined at definition level, task creators can specify warning date using DATE type with optional user-selected date/time.
>    5.2 When due date delay is not predefined at definition level, task creators must specify due date using DATE type with required user-selected date/time.
>    5.3 Alternative date type configurations support PERIOD (duration-based calculations), DATE (absolute date/time selection), or DEFAULT (inheritance from definition defaults).
> 6. Task definition is published and becomes available for task instance creation through REST API once effective date is reached.
> 7. Users create task instances based on configured definitions by providing entity association, selecting required due date/time, and optionally specifying warning date/time according to configured extension parameters.


**Acceptance Criteria:**

> 1. **Given** an administrator is creating a task definition, **When** they specify a definition ID, **Then** the system validates uniqueness across all task definitions and prevents duplicate IDs.
> 2. **Given** a task definition is configured with effectiveDate of 2021-11-17 and no expirationDate, **When** the current date is on or after 2021-11-17, **Then** the task definition is available for task instance creation indefinitely.
> 3. **Given** a task definition specifies priority value of 3 as read-only, **When** a user creates a task instance from this definition, **Then** the priority value cannot be modified during task creation or after task is created.
> 4. **Given** a task definition has extensionType configured with OpenL rules, **When** a task instance is created, **Then** all extension parameters defined in OpenL are available and validated according to their specified data types.
> 5. **Given** a task definition has warningDateDelay unset and warningDateType configured as DATE, **When** a user creates a task instance, **Then** the system allows optional selection of warningDateTime without requiring a value.
> 6. **Given** a task definition has dueDateDelay unset and dueDateType configured as DATE, **When** a user creates a task instance, **Then** the system requires mandatory selection of dueDateTime and blocks task creation if not provided.
> 7. **Given** a task definition supports three date type options (PERIOD, DATE, DEFAULT), **When** a user creates a task instance, **Then** the system correctly processes date/time values according to the selected type:
>    7.1 PERIOD calculates dates based on duration from reference point.
>    7.2 DATE uses the exact date/time value specified by user.
>    7.3 DEFAULT inherits date configuration from the task definition.
> 8. **Given** a task definition specifies entityType as CapEventCase and preferredQueueCd as claim_management, **When** a task instance is created via REST API, **Then** the task is associated with the specified event case entity and automatically assigned to the claim_management queue.
> 9. **Given** multiple task definitions exist in the system, **When** an administrator attempts to create a new definition with a duplicate definitionId, **Then** the system rejects the creation with a clear error message indicating ID conflict.
> 10. **Given** a task definition is configured with all required core attributes and extension parameters, **When** a user creates a task instance without providing mandatory fields (e.g., dueDateTime when required), **Then** the system blocks task creation and displays validation errors for missing required fields.

**Description:**

> **As a** Claims Adjuster,
> **I want to** view indexing history for long-term disability claims showing indexing dates, adjustment percentages, and benefit amounts,
> **so that** I can track cost-of-living adjustments applied to the claim and verify disability definition parameters.


**Key Capabilities:**

> 1. User accesses the Definition of Disability information via a dedicated tab on the Claim Overview screen, positioned next to the Policy Summary tab.
> 2. System displays Definition of Disability Details section showing disability definition parameters sourced from Master Policy → Plan → Disability Provisions.
>    2.1 For Short-Term Disability claims: Display STD-specific fields including Definition of Disability Formula, Minimum Partial Disability Earnings (%), Maximum Partial Disability Earnings (%), Partial Disability status, Test Definition, and Earning Test (%).
>    2.2 For Long-Term Disability claims: Display LTD-specific fields including Definition of Disability Formula, Minimum Partial Disability Earnings (%), Maximum Partial Disability Earnings (%), Partial Disability status, Test Definition, Own Occupation Earning Test (%), and Any Occupation Earning Test (%).
> 3. For Long-Term Disability claims, system additionally displays Indexing Details section showing adjustment configuration.
>    3.1 When Master Policy Plan has Indexing of Monthly Earnings = Yes: Display all indexing fields including Adjustment Percentage (e.g., CPI), CPI Type, Maximum Adjustment Percentage (%), Number of Adjustments (Unlimited/5/10), Waiting Period (Months), 1st Indexing Date (calculated), and Next Indexing Date (estimated).
>    3.2 When Master Policy Plan has Indexing of Monthly Earnings = No: Display 'N/A' in the Indexing Details section.
>    3.3 When claim closes or maximum adjustments reached: Display 'N/A' for Next Indexing Date field.
> 4. For Long-Term Disability claims with active indexing, system displays Indexing History table showing all historical adjustments sorted with most recent entries first.
>    4.1 Each history entry includes: Indexing Date (actual anniversary date), Adjustment Number (sequential count), Actual Index Percentage applied, Indexed Pre-Disability Monthly Earnings (calculated amount), and Maximum Partial Disability Earnings (calculated from indexed earnings).
>    4.2 When indexing anniversary date occurs: System automatically calculates and records new entry with current adjustment details and adds to top of history table.
> 5. System automatically manages indexing lifecycle based on claim status.
>    5.1 When claim closes or maximum adjustments reached: Stop recording new indexing history entries and mark Next Indexing Date as 'N/A'.
>    5.2 When claim reopens and maximum adjustments not yet reached: Resume indexing calculations, recalculate Next Indexing Date, and continue recording new history entries on anniversary dates.
> 6. All calculations and date determinations follow documented business rules for indexing anniversaries, adjustment percentages, and AGBA calculations.


**Acceptance Criteria:**

> 1. **Given** a Claims Adjuster accesses a Short-Term Disability claim, **When** viewing the Definition of Disability tab, **Then** the system displays Definition of Disability Details section with STD-specific fields only (Definition of Disability Formula, Minimum Partial Disability Earnings %, Maximum Partial Disability Earnings %, Partial Disability, Test Definition, Earning Test %) and does not display Indexing Details or Indexing History sections.
> 2. **Given** a Claims Adjuster accesses a Long-Term Disability claim, **When** viewing the Definition of Disability tab, **Then** the system displays Definition of Disability Details section with LTD-specific fields (Definition of Disability Formula, Minimum Partial Disability Earnings %, Maximum Partial Disability Earnings %, Partial Disability, Test Definition, Own Occupation Earning Test %, Any Occupation Earning Test %) and additionally displays Indexing Details and Indexing History sections.
> 3. **Given** an LTD claim where Master Policy Plan has Indexing of Monthly Earnings = Yes, **When** viewing the Indexing Details section, **Then** the system displays all indexing configuration fields with populated values including Adjustment Percentage, CPI Type, Maximum Adjustment Percentage, Number of Adjustments, Waiting Period, 1st Indexing Date (calculated), and Next Indexing Date (estimated).
> 4. **Given** an LTD claim where Master Policy Plan has Indexing of Monthly Earnings = No, **When** viewing the Indexing Details section, **Then** the system displays 'N/A' instead of showing indexing field values.
> 5. **Given** an LTD claim with active indexing, **When** viewing the Indexing History table, **Then** the system displays all historical adjustment entries sorted with most recent entries first, each containing Indexing Date, Adjustment Number, Actual Index Percentage, Indexed Pre-Disability Monthly Earnings, and Maximum Partial Disability Earnings.
> 6. **Given** an LTD claim reaches its indexing anniversary date, **When** the system processes the anniversary, **Then** a new entry is automatically added to the top of the Indexing History table with calculated values for that adjustment period.
> 7. **Given** an LTD claim closes or reaches maximum adjustment count, **When** viewing the Indexing Details section, **Then** the Next Indexing Date field displays 'N/A' and no new entries are added to Indexing History table.
> 8. **Given** a previously closed LTD claim reopens and has not reached maximum adjustments, **When** the claim status changes to active, **Then** the system recalculates and displays the Next Indexing Date and resumes recording new indexing history entries on subsequent anniversary dates.
> 9. **Given** a Claims Adjuster views any Definition of Disability tab, **When** the page loads, **Then** all displayed data is sourced from Master Policy → Plan → Disability Provisions and Indexing configurations and follows documented business rules for all calculations.
> 10. **Given** an LTD claim has no indexing history yet, **When** viewing the Indexing History section, **Then** the table is displayed empty with appropriate column headers visible and ready to display entries once anniversaries occur.

### Epic: Domain-Specific Capabilities & Logic

#### Feature: As a Claims Adjuster, I want to retrieve policy summary information at event case intake, so that I can verify coverage details and assist with coverage investigation
- **Role**: Claims Adjuster
- **Action**: retrieve and integrate policy summary information, coverage details, eligibility criteria, and benefit structures at event case intake and throughout the claims lifecycle
- **Value**: I can verify coverage details, validate claim eligibility, support coverage investigation, and accurately calculate settlement amounts based on policy terms and conditions

**Description:**

> **As a** Claims Adjuster,
> **I want to** retrieve and integrate policy summary information, coverage details, eligibility criteria, and benefit structures at event case intake and throughout the claims lifecycle,
> **so that** I can verify coverage details, validate claim eligibility, support coverage investigation, and accurately calculate settlement amounts based on policy terms and conditions.


**Key Capabilities:**

> [
>   "1. **Event Case Level - Policy Search and Population:**",
>   "   1.1 Upon event case creation (triggered by 'createCase' command), system automatically searches indexed policies by indicated date and registry IDs.",
>   "   1.2 System transforms and maps policy summary information into the Event Case using policy indexing and projection processes.",
>   "   1.3 Policy general summary information is made available to claims adjuster to support initial coverage verification at intake.",
>   "2. **Loss Level - Comprehensive Policy Integration:**",
>   "   2.1 Upon loss creation (triggered by 'createLoss' command), system resolves full policy image using stored policy ID.",
>   "   2.2 System maps comprehensive policy data including summary information, coverage details, eligibility criteria, age reduction rules, and benefit structures into ClaimWrapper entity.",
>   "   2.3 Claims adjuster can access detailed coverage list for selection and validation during loss event processing.",
>   "   2.4 System applies applicability rules to validate claim eligibility against policy terms and conditions.",
>   "   2.5 **Alternate Flow - Unverified Policy at Loss Level:** When processing unverified policies, system maps limited subset of data including only summary information and basic coverage data (no eligibility or age reduction details).",
>   "3. **Settlement Level - Benefit Calculation and Adjudication:**",
>   "   3.1 Upon settlement adjudication (triggered by 'adjudicateSettlement' command), system resolves full policy image using stored policy ID.",
>   "   3.2 System maps policy benefit information including coverage codes, benefit amounts, time periods, maximum benefit numbers, and lifetime maximums into Settlement entity.",
>   "   3.3 Claims adjuster can calculate gross and payable settlement amounts based on integrated policy conditions, benefit structures, and coverage terms.",
>   "   3.4 **Alternate Flow - Unverified Policy at Settlement Level:** When processing unverified policies, system maps only summary information and basic benefit information without detailed benefit structure attributes.",
>   "4. **Cross-Stage Data Consistency:**",
>   "   4.1 Policy integration attributes are stored centrally in ClaimWrapper entity to ensure consistency across all claim processing stages.",
>   "   4.2 System maintains policy version control and tracks policy status, effective dates, and product codes throughout the claim lifecycle.",
>   "   4.3 Claims adjuster can view related master policy and certificate policy information for group insurance scenarios.",
>   "5. **Product Line Extension Support:**",
>   "   5.1 **Alternate Flow - Term Life Processing:** For term life applications, system follows same three-stage integration pattern with term life specific configurations.",
>   "   5.2 **Alternate Flow - Other Product Lines:** Integration capability extends to Group Term Life and Hospital Indemnity through product-specific configuration and transformation mappings."

#### Feature: As a Claims Adjuster, I want the system to apply age reduction rules and benefit structures from policy, so that benefit calculations reflect applicable policy modifications
- **Role**: Claims Adjuster
- **Action**: retrieve and apply age reduction rules and benefit structures from verified or unverified Hospital Indemnity policies to claim settlements
- **Value**: benefit calculations accurately reflect applicable policy modifications and coverage terms, ensuring correct claim adjudication and payment amounts

**Description:**

> **As a** Claims Adjuster,
> **I want to** retrieve and apply age reduction rules and benefit structures from verified or unverified Hospital Indemnity policies to claim settlements,
> **so that** benefit calculations accurately reflect applicable policy modifications and coverage terms, ensuring correct claim adjudication and payment amounts.


**Key Capabilities:**

> 1. The system retrieves policy summary information during event case creation by searching indexed policies using indicated date and registryIds, then transforms and maps policy data into CapEventCase.CapPolicyInfoEntity.
> 2. During loss creation (createLoss command), the system resolves the full policy image using stored policyId and maps comprehensive policy data including summary, coverage, and eligibility information into ClaimWrapper.CapClaimWrapperPolicyInfoEntity.
>    2.1 For unverified policies during loss creation, the system integrates summary and coverage information only, excluding benefit details, using entities marked with @UnverifiedPolicy annotation.
> 3. During settlement adjudication (adjudicateSettlement command), the system resolves the full policy image and maps policy data including summary, coverage, and benefit information into HISettlement.CapHISettlementPolicyInfoEntity.
>    3.1 For unverified policies during settlement adjudication, the system integrates summary and benefit information through specialized transformation mappings.
> 4. The system applies age reduction rules retrieved from policy coverage information, including age codes and reduction percentages, to calculate adjusted benefit amounts.
> 5. The system utilizes benefit structure configurations from policies, including benefit type codes, increment amounts, maximum/minimum benefit amounts, approved amounts, and rounding methods for settlement calculations.
> 6. The system maps policy eligibility parameters including waiting period amounts, waiting period mode codes, eligibility type codes, and waiting period definitions to validate claim coverage.
> 7. The system provides claim handlers with policy coverage lists derived from master and individual policy benefits, enabling appropriate coverage selection for loss events.
> 8. The system calculates gross and potential payable amounts based on policy face values, benefit structures, age reduction rules, and other policy terms integrated during the adjudication phase.
> 9. The system supports extension to additional product lines (e.g., Group Term Life) through configuration of applicability rules, lookups, and development of product-specific transformation mappings.


**Acceptance Criteria:**

> 1. **Given** an event case is being created for a Hospital Indemnity claim, **When** the createCase command is executed with indicated date and registryIds, **Then** the system searches indexed policies and populates CapEventCase.CapPolicyInfoEntity with policy summary information including masterPolicyId, policyNumber, productCd, policyStatus, and riskStateCd within 5 seconds.
> 2. **Given** a ClaimWrapper loss is being created with a valid policyId, **When** the createLoss command executes, **Then** the system resolves the full policy image and maps policy summary, coverage, and eligibility data into CapClaimWrapperPolicyInfoEntity including capCoverageInfo with isAgeReductionApplied flag, benefitStructures, ageReductionDetails, and eligibility parameters.
>    2.1 **Given** the policy is unverified during loss creation, **When** the mapping occurs, **Then** the system includes only summary and coverage information, excludes benefit details, and marks entities with @UnverifiedPolicy annotation.
> 3. **Given** an HISettlement is being adjudicated with a valid policyId, **When** the adjudicateSettlement command executes, **Then** the system resolves the full policy image and maps policy summary, coverage, and benefit information into HISettlement.CapHISettlementPolicyInfoEntity.
>    3.1 **Given** the policy is unverified during settlement adjudication, **When** the mapping occurs, **Then** the system includes summary and benefit information using CapLifeUnverifiedPolicyToHISettlement transformation.
> 4. **Given** a policy has age reduction rules defined with specific age codes and reduction percentages, **When** settlement adjudication calculates benefits, **Then** the system applies the age reduction rules from CapAgeReductionDetailsEntity (ageCd, reducedToCd) and correctly adjusts benefit amounts accordingly.
> 5. **Given** a policy benefit structure includes incrementAmount, maxBenefitAmount, minBenefitAmount, benefitAmount, and roundingMethod, **When** the system calculates settlement amounts, **Then** the gross and potential payable amounts reflect all benefit structure parameters from CapCoverageBenefitStructuresEntity.
> 6. **Given** a policy has eligibility parameters including waitingPeriodAmount and waitingPeriodModeCd, **When** a claim is processed, **Then** the system validates claim coverage against CapEligibilityEntity parameters and blocks adjudication if eligibility conditions are not met.
> 7. **Given** OpenL configuration file _api_life_coverage_based.xls contains HI Coverage List with policy benefit mappings, **When** a claim handler views available coverages, **Then** the system displays only those policy benefits marked as available for the specific package code, plan code, and policy benefit code combination.
> 8. **Given** policy-support-override.properties maps HIMaster and HIIndividual products to ClaimWrapper, HILoss, and HISettlement models, **When** the system processes a claim for these products, **Then** policy integration executes across all three phases (event case, loss creation, settlement adjudication) without configuration errors.
> 9. **Given** policy-api-config-override.properties contains invalid or unreachable policy application URLs, **When** the system attempts policy integration during any phase, **Then** the system logs a clear error message indicating the failed policy endpoint and prevents incomplete data mapping.
> 10. **Given** a Hospital Indemnity policy has multiple insureds with isMain flags, **When** policy data is mapped to ClaimWrapper, **Then** the system correctly populates insureds collection in CapInsuredInfo with accurate registryTypeId and isMain indicator for each insured.
> 11. **Given** the system is being extended to support Group Term Life products, **When** configuration is added to life-policy-support-override.properties and CapLifeUnverifiedPolicy settings are included, **Then** the system processes Group Term Life claims using appropriate transformation mappings without impacting Hospital Indemnity claim processing.

#### Feature: As a System Administrator, I want to configure supported loss and settlement models for each product in policy support configuration, so that policy validation correctly identifies applicable claim models
- **Role**: System Administrator
- **Action**: configure supported loss and settlement models for each product in policy support configuration
- **Value**: policy validation correctly identifies applicable claim models and enables seamless policy-to-claim integration across event case creation, loss processing, and settlement adjudication

**Description:**

> **As a** System Administrator,
> **I want to** configure supported loss and settlement models for each product in policy support configuration,
> **so that** policy validation correctly identifies applicable claim models and enables seamless policy-to-claim integration across event case creation, loss processing, and settlement adjudication.


**Key Capabilities:**

> 1. System administrator configures policy support mappings that establish relationships between policy products and supported claim models.
>    1.1 For verified policies, administrator maps policy products (e.g., GTLMaster, TLIndividual) to supported loss models (DeathLoss, AcceleratedLoss, AccidentalDismembermentLoss, PremiumWaiverLoss) and settlement models (DeathSettlement, AcceleratedSettlement, AccidentalDismembermentSettlement, PremiumWaiverSettlement).
>    1.2 For unverified policies, administrator ensures CapLifeUnverifiedPolicy includes same model values as verified policy mappings to maintain processing consistency.
>    1.3 Administrator configures policy application URLs and API entity links to enable policy data retrieval during claim processing.
> 2. During Event Case Creation phase, system leverages configuration to search indexed policies and populate policy summary information into the event case.
>    2.1 System executes policy search by indicated date and registry identifiers based on configured policy models.
>    2.2 System transforms and maps policy summary information using configured transformation mappings.
> 3. During Loss Creation phase, system utilizes configuration to resolve full policy image and map policy data into claim wrapper attributes.
>    3.1 System maps policy data including summary information, coverage, eligibility, age reduction, and benefit structure based on configured transformations.
>    3.2 For unverified policies, system applies alternate transformation logic that excludes benefit details at loss level.
>    3.3 System restricts coverage selection options to current loss events based on configured loss-to-coverage relationships.
> 4. During Settlement Adjudication phase, system applies configuration to map policy data into settlement-specific entities.
>    4.1 System resolves policy data and maps summary information and benefit details to corresponding settlement types based on configured settlement model mappings.
>    4.2 Each settlement type (Death, Accelerated, Accidental Dismemberment, Premium Waiver) uses distinct transformation configurations.
>    4.3 For unverified policies, system includes benefit details during settlement adjudication using alternate transformation mappings.
> 5. System enables coverage-based processing capabilities through configuration.
>    5.1 Administrator configures which policy benefits are available for claim processing and validation through OpenL coverage list settings.
>    5.2 Administrator defines detailed attribute mapping from policy benefits to settlement benefit information through OpenL coverage configuration.
>    5.3 System executes applicability rules, calculates gross amounts and potential payable amounts based on configured policy-to-claim mappings.
> 6. Configuration supports extensibility to additional product lines through modification of applicability rules, transformation mappings, and coverage-based lookup tables.


**Acceptance Criteria:**

> 1. **Given** a system administrator configures policy-support-override.properties with GTLMaster mapped to DeathLoss, ClaimWrapper, and DeathSettlement models, **When** an event case is created for a GTLMaster policy, **Then** the system successfully searches and retrieves the policy, populates policy summary information into the event case, and enables creation of DeathLoss with appropriate settlement options.
> 2. **Given** policy application URLs and API links are configured in policy-api-config-override.properties, **When** loss creation is initiated, **Then** the system resolves the full policy image within 5 seconds and maps coverage, eligibility, and benefit structure data into ClaimWrapper policy BE attributes without manual intervention.
> 3. **Given** CapLifeUnverifiedPolicy is configured with the same model mappings as verified GTLMaster and TLIndividual policies, **When** a claim is processed against an unverified policy, **Then** the system maps summary and coverage information at loss level (excluding benefit details) and includes benefit details during settlement adjudication using the alternate unverified transformation logic.
> 4. **Given** OpenL TL Coverage List sheet is configured with specific policy benefits marked as available, **When** a user creates a loss for an Accelerated event, **Then** the system restricts coverage selection to only accelerated coverage options and prevents selection of death coverage or unrelated benefits.
> 5. **Given** OpenL TL Coverage Config sheet defines benefit-level mapping from policy to settlement, **When** settlement adjudication is executed, **Then** the system correctly calculates gross amount and potential payable amount based on configured policy face value, age reduction factors, and benefit structure rules.
> 6. **Given** separate settlement transformations are configured for DeathSettlement, AcceleratedSettlement, AccidentalDismembermentSettlement, and PremiumWaiverSettlement, **When** adjudicateSettlement command is invoked for each settlement type, **Then** the system applies the correct transformation mapping and populates settlement-specific policy information entities without data leakage between settlement types.
> 7. **Given** policy search indexing and projection include required term life policy models (IndToPolicyVersion, MasterToPolicyVersion, UPToPolicyVersion), **When** event case creation triggers policy search, **Then** the system returns matching policies within 3 seconds based on indicated date and registry identifiers.
> 8. **Given** ClaimWrapper eligibility validation rules are configured in OpenL '_api_claim_wrapper_eligibility.xlsx', **When** loss creation occurs after policy data mapping, **Then** the system validates integrated policy data and blocks loss creation with inline error messages if eligibility criteria are not met.
> 9. **Given** a policy product is NOT included in policy-support-override.properties model mappings, **When** an attempt is made to create a claim for that policy product, **Then** the system prevents claim creation and displays an error message indicating the product is not supported for claims processing.
> 10. **Given** an administrator modifies policy-support-override.properties to add a new product line (e.g., Critical Illness) with corresponding loss and settlement models, **When** the configuration is deployed and a claim is created for the new product, **Then** the system successfully executes the complete integration flow across event case, loss creation, and settlement adjudication phases using the newly configured mappings.
> 11. **Given** local development environment requires policy mock data, **When** administrator configures /docker/dev/policy.yml with policy app images and invokes CAP mock app 'write' endpoint, **Then** the system creates mocked policies accessible for testing claim-policy integration without dependency on external policy systems.
> 12. **Given** transformation files (CapEventCasePolicyInfo.gtransformation, ClaimWrapperInfo.gtransformation, DeathSettlementInfo.gtransformation, etc.) are properly configured, **When** each integration phase executes, **Then** policy data is accurately transformed and stored in the appropriate entity attributes (CapEventCase.CapPolicyInfoEntity, ClaimWrapper.CapClaimWrapperPolicyInfoEntity, Settlement.CapXXXSettlementPolicyInfoEntity) with data integrity maintained across all phases.

#### Feature: As a Claims Adjuster, I want to verify policy eligibility criteria including waiting periods and eligibility types, so that I can determine if a claim meets policy requirements
- **Role**: Claims Adjuster
- **Action**: verify policy eligibility criteria including waiting periods and eligibility types, and integrate policy information across event case, loss, and settlement processes
- **Value**: I can determine if a claim meets policy requirements and accurately adjudicate critical illness claims based on complete policy terms, coverages, and benefit structures

**Description:**

> **As a** Claims Adjuster,
> **I want to** verify policy eligibility criteria including waiting periods and eligibility types, and integrate policy information across event case, loss, and settlement processes,
> **so that** I can determine if a claim meets policy requirements and accurately adjudicate critical illness claims based on complete policy terms, coverages, and benefit structures.


**Key Capabilities:**

> 1. **Event Case Creation - Initial Policy Discovery**: System searches and retrieves matching policies by indicated date and registry IDs when event case is created, then maps policy summary information into the event case entity through policy transformation logic.
>
> 2. **Loss Creation - Comprehensive Policy Integration**: Upon loss creation, system resolves the full policy image and maps extensive policy data into ClaimWrapper including:
>    - Policy summary information (policy numbers, IDs, product codes, status, term)
>    - Coverage details with age reduction rules and benefit structures
>    - Eligibility rules (waiting period amount, waiting period mode, eligibility type, waiting period definition)
>    - Benefit structure (benefit types, amounts, multiples, rounding methods)
>    - Insured and beneficiary information
>    2.1. **Alternate Flow - Unverified Policy at Loss**: When unverified policy is used, system applies modified transformation that integrates summary and coverage information only, excluding detailed benefit data.
>    2.2. System applies additional validation rules after policy mapping completes to ensure integrated policy data meets business requirements.
>
> 3. **Coverage Availability Determination**: System evaluates which policy benefits are available for claim based on configured conditions including relationship to participant, package code, plan code, policy coverage code, policy benefit code, and covered condition indicators.
>
> 4. **Settlement Adjudication - Benefit Calculation**: Upon settlement adjudication, system resolves policy image again and maps policy data including detailed benefit parameters (benefit amounts, time period codes, maximum benefit numbers, lifetime maximum benefit amount percentages) to enable calculation of gross amount and potential payable amount.
>    4.1. **Alternate Flow - Unverified Policy at Settlement**: When unverified policy is used during settlement, system applies alternate transformation integrating summary and benefit information only.
>
> 5. **Policy Verification Status Handling**: System distinguishes between verified and unverified policies throughout the claim lifecycle, applying appropriate data mapping and validation rules based on verification status.
>
> 6. **Eligibility Criteria Validation**: System verifies waiting periods, eligibility types, and waiting period definitions against policy terms to determine claim eligibility and coverage applicability.


**Acceptance Criteria:**

> 1. **Given** an event case is created with valid indicated date and registry IDs, **When** the system invokes policy search, **Then** matching master or individual policies are retrieved and policy summary information is populated into the event case entity within the expected timeframe.
>
> 2. **Given** a loss is created for a critical illness claim with verified policy, **When** the system performs policy integration, **Then** ClaimWrapper entity contains complete policy information including:
>    - Policy identification (master policy ID, policy numbers, policy type)
>    - Coverage details with age reduction flags and details
>    - Eligibility rules (waiting period amount, mode code, eligibility type code, definition code)
>    - Benefit structures with amounts, multiples, and rounding methods
>    - Insured collection with main insured indicator and registry type IDs
>
> 3. **Given** a loss is created with unverified policy, **When** the system performs policy integration, **Then** ClaimWrapper contains summary and coverage information only, without detailed benefit data, and is marked with unverified status.
>
> 4. **Given** policy data is mapped into ClaimWrapper, **When** additional validation rules are executed, **Then** all eligibility criteria including waiting periods and eligibility types are validated against configured business rules, and validation failures produce specific error messages.
>
> 5. **Given** a settlement requires adjudication, **When** the system resolves policy information, **Then** settlement entity contains policy summary, coverage details, and benefit details including benefit amount, time period code, maximum benefit number, and lifetime maximum benefit amount percentage.
>
> 6. **Given** coverage availability logic is configured in OpenL table, **When** the system evaluates benefit applicability, **Then** only benefits meeting configured conditions (relationship to participant, package code, plan code, policy coverage code, policy benefit code) are marked as available for the claim.
>
> 7. **Given** benefit attribute mapping is configured in OpenL table, **When** the system maps policy benefits to settlement, **Then** benefit level parameters are accurately transferred to settlement benefit info fields including benefit amounts, time periods, and maximum benefit numbers.
>
> 8. **Given** a settlement is adjudicated with complete policy integration, **When** the system calculates payable amounts, **Then** gross amount and potential payable amount are computed based on integrated policy conditions, benefit structures, and age reduction rules.
>
> 9. **Given** policy application URLs and API links are configured, **When** the system attempts to retrieve policy data during any integration point, **Then** the system successfully connects to the configured CI Master or CI Individual application endpoints.
>
> 10. **Negative Scenario - Given** policy cannot be found during event case creation, **When** the system completes policy search, **Then** event case is created without policy information and appropriate indicators are set for manual policy association.
>
> 11. **Negative Scenario - Given** waiting period has not been satisfied, **When** eligibility validation is performed at loss creation, **Then** system flags the eligibility violation and prevents automatic claim initiation or presents validation warnings to the adjuster.
>
> 12. **Negative Scenario - Given** eligibility type code does not match policy requirements, **When** eligibility validation is executed, **Then** system produces validation error identifying the specific eligibility type mismatch and required criteria.

#### Feature: As a Claims Adjuster, I want to identify main insureds and other insureds from policy information, so that I can correctly determine coverage applicability for each party
- **Role**: Claims Adjuster
- **Action**: integrate comprehensive policy information (including main insureds, other insureds, coverages, benefits, and eligibility details) from master and certificate policies throughout the claims lifecycle
- **Value**: I can correctly determine coverage applicability for each party, perform accurate adjudication, and make informed settlement decisions based on validated policy terms and conditions

**Description:**

> **As a** Claims Adjuster,
> **I want to** integrate comprehensive policy information (including main insureds, other insureds, coverages, benefits, and eligibility details) from master and certificate policies throughout the claims lifecycle,
> **so that** I can correctly determine coverage applicability for each party, perform accurate adjudication, and make informed settlement decisions based on validated policy terms and conditions.


**Key Capabilities:**

> 1. During Event Case Intake, the system searches for applicable policies using the indicated date and registry IDs, then transforms and maps policy summary information into the Event Case entity.
> 2. Upon Loss Creation within the ClaimWrapper domain, the system resolves the full policy image and maps comprehensive policy data including policy summary, coverage, eligibility, age reduction, and benefit structure into ClaimWrapper policy attributes (not individual loss entities).
> 3. During Coverage Selection, the system retrieves and displays available coverage options restricted to the current loss event, ensuring accelerated losses can only add accelerated coverage and death losses can only add death coverage.
> 4. Throughout Settlement Adjudication for all settlement types (Death, Accelerated, Accidental Dismemberment, Premium Waiver), the system resolves full policy images and maps relevant policy data into settlement-specific policy information entities.
> 5. The system performs automated Face Value calculations based on integrated policy data and displays results on the UI for adjuster review.
> 6. The system calculates gross amounts and potential payable amounts based on policy conditions, terms, benefit structures, and configured business rules.
> 7. The system defaults values for Benefit Period and Elimination Period for Premium Waiver settlements based on policy terms.
> 8. The system enables adjuster viewing of comprehensive policy and coverage information directly within the Claim UI without requiring navigation to separate policy systems.
> 9. The system validates loss events against integrated term life policy data during ClaimWrapper creation phase to ensure eligibility and compliance.
> 10. The system applies applicability rules to initiate and finalize losses after validation, inheriting validation parameters from policy data.
>   10.1 For Unverified Policy scenarios, the system uses alternative transformation logic to integrate summary and coverage information at the Loss level and settlement level, ensuring claims processing can proceed even when policy verification is pending.
>   10.2 When custom policy search requirements exist, the system supports modification of search behavior to accommodate alternate search criteria while maintaining data integrity.
>   10.3 When additional policy attributes require integration beyond standard configuration, the system supports extension through modified transformation files and OpenL table configurations.


**Acceptance Criteria:**

> 1. **Given** an Event Case is being created **when** the createCase command is executed **then** the system searches indexed policies by indicated date and registryIds within 3 seconds and populates policy summary information into CapEventCase.CapPolicyInfoEntity.
> 2. **Given** a ClaimWrapper Loss is being created **when** the createLoss command is executed **then** the system resolves the full policy image by stored policyId and maps comprehensive policy data (summary, coverage, eligibility, ageReduction, benefitStructure) into ClaimWrapper.CapClaimWrapperPolicyInfoEntity.
> 3. **Given** a Coverage Selection is initiated **when** the adjuster views available coverages **then** the system displays only coverages applicable to the current loss event type (accelerated coverage for accelerated loss, death coverage for death loss).
>   3.1 **Given** configuration exists in OpenL '_api_life_coverage_based.xls' TL Coverage List sheet **when** the system evaluates available benefits **then** only benefits with valid Available Indicator path are displayed as selectable options.
> 4. **Given** a Settlement Adjudication is initiated for any settlement type **when** the adjudicateSettlement command is executed **then** the system resolves full policy image and maps policy data into the corresponding Settlement.CapXXXSettlementPolicyInfoEntity within 2 seconds.
> 5. **Given** policy data has been integrated into ClaimWrapper **when** Face Value calculation is triggered **then** the system calculates and displays the default Face Value on the UI based on policy benefit structure, increment amount, and approved amount.
> 6. **Given** settlement calculation is performed **when** gross amount and potential payable amount are computed **then** the system applies policy conditions including age reduction details, benefit structures, salary multiples, rounding methods, and annual earnings amount.
> 7. **Given** a Premium Waiver settlement is created **when** default values are populated **then** the system automatically defaults Benefit Period and Elimination Period values from integrated policy terms.
> 8. **Given** an adjuster is reviewing a claim **when** they access the Claim UI **then** comprehensive policy and coverage information (policy number, package code, plan code, product code, insureds, coverage details, benefit structures) is visible without requiring external policy system access.
> 9. **Given** loss event validation is required **when** ClaimWrapper creation occurs after policy mapping **then** the system validates the loss event against integrated term life policy data using OpenL '_api_claim_wrapper_eligibility.xlsx' rules.
>   9.1 **Given** validation fails due to eligibility criteria **when** the validation result is returned **then** the system prevents loss creation and displays specific eligibility failure reasons to the adjuster.
> 10. **Given** a policy is marked as unverified **when** ClaimWrapper or Settlement integration occurs **then** the system uses CapLifeUnverifiedPolicyToClaimWrapper.gtransformation and corresponding CapLifeUnverifiedPolicyToXXXSettlement.gtransformation files to integrate summary and coverage/benefit information.
> 11. **Given** a policy search is executed **when** multiple policies match the search criteria **then** the system returns all matching GTLMaster and TLIndividual policies indexed and projected according to configured transformation files.
> 12. **Given** applicability rules are configured **when** a loss is created **then** the system runs applicability rules to initiate the loss and inherits validation parameters from the integrated policy data.
> 13. **Given** additional policy attributes are required beyond standard configuration **when** transformation files and OpenL tables are modified per technical implementation guidelines **then** the system successfully maps and displays the additional attributes in ClaimWrapper and Settlement entities.
> 14. **Given** an Accelerated Loss is being created **when** the adjuster attempts to add coverage **then** the system restricts coverage selection to accelerated coverage only and prevents selection of death or other coverage types.
> 15. **Given** benefit attribute mapping is configured in OpenL '_api_life_coverage_based.xls' TL Coverage Config sheet column 'N' **when** settlement is created **then** the system maps detailed attributes from policy Benefits to settlement capBenefitInfo according to the configuration.

### Epic: Policy System Foundation & Rules Engine

#### Feature: As a System Administrator, I want to configure policy data model attributes for each product line (Life, Disability, Dental, Accident, Pet), so that claim systems can correctly map and retrieve policy information during case creation and claim adjudication.
- **Role**: System Administrator
- **Action**: configure policy data model attributes for each product line (Life, Disability, Dental, Accident, Pet) and establish integration mappings with external policy systems
- **Value**: claim systems can correctly retrieve, map, and transform policy information during case creation, claim adjudication, and settlement processing across all supported product lines

**Description:**

> **As a** System Administrator,
> **I want to** configure policy data model attributes for each product line (Life, Disability, Dental, Accident, Pet) and establish integration mappings with external policy systems,
> **so that** claim systems can correctly retrieve, map, and transform policy information during case creation, claim adjudication, and settlement processing across all supported product lines.


**Key Capabilities:**

> 1. Administrator configures policy data model attributes for each supported product line, including Life policies (ACCIndividual, ACCMaster, CIIndividual, CIMaster, GTLMaster, TLIndividual, GPLUIndividual, HIIndividual, HIMaster), Disability policies (LeaveIndividual, LeaveMaster, STDIndividual, STDMaster with LTD/STD packages, SMPMaster), and Unverified Policies.
> 2. System establishes integration with external policy systems following a standardized pattern: command execution triggers policy data requirement check, missing data invokes policy populator, populator searches applicable policies using context-specific criteria, retrieved data is transformed using model-specific transformation files, and transformed data is stored in target entity.
> 3. For Event Case creation context, system automatically populates policy data when createCase command executes:
>    3.1 System detects policy holder entity lacks policy data during case creation.
>    3.2 System invokes EventCase policy populator using Event Date as the search date parameter.
>    3.3 System routes transformation through CapEventCasePolicyInfo based on Policy Product/Model Name.
>    3.4 Transformation files follow naming convention: &lt;Policy._modelName&gt;ToPolicyInfo (STD policies use &lt;Policy.packageCd&gt;&lt;Policy._modelName&gt;ToPolicyInfo) located in /cap-case-hna-domain/modeling/policy_transformations.
> 4. For Claim/Loss creation context, system populates policy data when createLoss command executes:
>    4.1 For Disability Claims: System invokes CapDisabilityPolicyPopulator using lossDetail.lastWorkDate as search date, resolves policy by capPolicyVersionId if versioned or by capPolicyId with date range validation if unversioned (sorted by policySystemRevisionNo DESC), and routes to disability-specific transformations (CapStdDisabilityPolicyInfo, CapLtdDisabilityPolicyInfo, CapSmpDisabilityPolicyInfo, CapLeaveDisabilityPolicyInfo) following naming convention &lt;Policy._modelName&gt;ToLoss located in /cap-loss-disability-domain/modeling/policy_transformations.
>    4.2 For Life Claims: System invokes CapClaimWrapperPolicyPopulator using lossDetail.claimLossDate as search date, applies same version/date resolution logic as Disability claims, and routes through CapClaimWrapperPolicyInfo.gtransformation following naming convention &lt;Policy._modelName&gt;ToClaimWrapper located in /cap-loss-term-life-domain/modeling/policy_transformation.
> 5. For Settlement adjudication context, system integrates policy data when adjudicateSettlement command executes:
>    5.1 For Disability Settlements: System triggers settlement-specific transformations for CapStdSettlement, CapLtdSettlement, CapSmpSettlement, and CapLeaveSettlement using naming convention &lt;Policy._modelName&gt;To&lt;Settlement._modelName&gt; located in /cap-adjudication-disability-domain/modeling/&lt;SettlementModel&gt;/policy_transformations.
>    5.2 For Life Settlements: System triggers transformations for AcceleratedSettlement, DeathSettlement, CISettlement, HISettlement, AccidentalDismembermentSettlement, and PremiumWaiverSettlement using naming convention &lt;Policy._modelName&gt;To&lt;Settlement._modelName&gt; located in /cap-adjudication-term-life-domain/modeling/&lt;SettlementModel&gt;/policy_transformations.
> 6. Administrator configures policy resolution rules applying consistent date range logic (effTxEffectiveDate ≤ searchDate AND effTxExpirationDate ≥ searchDate) combined with revision number sorting for unversioned policies.
> 7. System maintains segregated transformation file locations by domain (case-hna, loss-disability, loss-term-life, adjudication-disability, adjudication-term-life) to support modular configuration and maintenance.


**Acceptance Criteria:**

> 1. **Given** an administrator configures policy model attributes for Life product line (e.g., GTLMaster), **when** a createCase command executes for a policy holder without policy data, **then** the system invokes CapEventCasePolicyPopulator using Event Date as search parameter and successfully retrieves and transforms policy data within 3 seconds.
> 2. **Given** a policy exists in versioned state with capPolicyVersionId, **when** a createLoss command executes for a Disability claim, **then** the system matches policy by capPolicyVersionId and applies STDMasterToLoss transformation located in /cap-loss-disability-domain/modeling/policy_transformations.
> 3. **Given** a policy exists in unversioned state without capPolicyVersionId, **when** system searches for applicable policy during Life claim creation, **then** the system matches by capPolicyId where effTxEffectiveDate ≤ claimLossDate AND effTxExpirationDate ≥ claimLossDate, sorted by policySystemRevisionNo in descending order, and returns the most recent valid policy version.
> 4. **Given** multiple policy models are configured (STDIndividual with STD package, LeaveMaster, ACCIndividual), **when** createLoss commands execute for corresponding claim types, **then** system routes each to correct transformation file following naming convention: STDSTDIndividualToLoss for STD claims, LeaveMasterToLoss for Leave claims, and ACCIndividualToClaimWrapper for Accident claims.
> 5. **Given** a Disability Settlement requires adjudication, **when** adjudicateSettlement command executes, **then** system triggers CommandListener('Execute', 'adjudicateSettlement') and applies transformation &lt;Policy._modelName&gt;ToCapStdSettlement located in /cap-adjudication-disability-domain/modeling/CapStdSettlement/policy_transformations.
> 6. **Given** an Unverified Policy exists in the system, **when** policy population is triggered in any context (EventCase, Claim, or Settlement), **then** system successfully retrieves and transforms unverified policy data following the same transformation rules as verified policies.
> 7. **Given** transformation files are organized by domain and settlement model, **when** administrator updates a Life Settlement transformation for DeathSettlement, **then** the file is correctly located in /cap-adjudication-term-life-domain/modeling/DeathSettlement/policy_transformations and changes apply only to Death Settlement adjudications without affecting other settlement types.
> 8. **Given** policy data is missing during EventCase creation, **when** policyPopulator.populate() is invoked, **then** system completes policy search, transformation via CapEventCasePolicyInfo.gtransformation, and data storage before createCase command completes execution.
> 9. **Given** a policy model naming convention is defined as &lt;Policy._modelName&gt;To&lt;Settlement._modelName&gt;, **when** system processes settlements for multiple Life products (GTLMaster, TLIndividual, CIMaster), **then** each policy model routes to correctly named transformation file (GTLMasterToDeathSettlement, TLIndividualToDeathSettlement, CIMasterToCISettlement).
> 10. **Given** search date logic varies by context, **when** system processes EventCase (uses Event Date), Disability Claim (uses lastWorkDate), and Life Claim (uses claimLossDate) in sequence, **then** each context applies its designated search date parameter correctly and retrieves appropriate policy versions without cross-contamination of date criteria.

#### Feature: As a Claims Examiner, I want to calculate face value for life and critical illness claims based on policy-defined structures (flat amount, salary multiple, percentage of employee amount, or scheduled items), so that benefit amounts are determined correctly according to policy terms.
- **Role**: Claims Examiner
- **Action**: calculate face value for life and critical illness claims based on policy-defined structures (flat amount, salary multiple, percentage of employee amount, or scheduled items)
- **Value**: benefit amounts are determined correctly according to policy terms

**Description:**

> **As a** Claims Examiner,
> **I want to** calculate face value for life and critical illness claims based on policy-defined structures (flat amount, salary multiple, percentage of employee amount, or scheduled items),
> **so that** benefit amounts are determined correctly according to policy terms.


**Key Capabilities:**

> 1. System derives Face Value from policy data for Term Life and Critical Illness policies, representing the primary amount payable before additions or reductions.
> 2. For Term Life Member Coverage (TermLife, ADD):
>   2.1 System retrieves Face Value from certificate policies for range value benefit types.
>   2.2 System stores Face Value as benefitAmount based on policy structure (range values within min/max/increment, multiple values from specified amounts, single flat amount, or multiple of salary with rounding).
>   2.3 When coverage includes Core and Buyup components, system combines both amounts to calculate total Face Value.
> 3. For Term Life Dependent Coverage (spouse and child):
>   3.1 System calculates spouse Face Value based on policy structure: range values, multiple values, flat amount (minimum of defined amount and maximum of employee coverage), or percentage of employee amount (minimum of percentage calculation and maximum benefit).
>   3.2 System calculates child Face Value as minimum of flat amount or percentage of employee's approved amount and maximum of employee coverage.
>   3.3 System stores dependent Face Values as benefitAmount.
> 4. For Critical Illness Individual Coverage:
>   4.1 System retrieves Face Value (Principal Sum) from certificate policies for range value benefit types, constrained by Guaranteed Issue Amount.
>   4.2 System stores Face Value as approvedAmount.
>   4.3 When Age Reduction is enabled and primary insured age meets or exceeds CI Reduction Age, system applies Formula FV001 to reduce Face Value.
> 5. For Critical Illness Spouse Coverage:
>   5.1 System retrieves Face Value from certificate policies for range values (constrained by Guaranteed Issue Amount) or calculates as percentage of individual's approved amount.
>   5.2 System stores Face Value as approvedAmount.
>   5.3 For percentage-based coverage only, when Age Reduction is enabled and primary insured age meets or exceeds CI Reduction Age, system applies Formula FV002.
> 6. For Critical Illness Child Coverage:
>   6.1 System retrieves Face Value from certificate policies as fixed amount or calculates as percentage of individual's approved amount.
>   6.2 System stores Face Value as childBenefitAmount.
>   6.3 For percentage-based coverage only, when Age Reduction is enabled and primary insured age meets or exceeds CI Reduction Age, system applies Formula FV001.
> 7. System uses derived Face Value to calculate scheduled items for CI claims, applying flat amounts or formula-based percentages (e.g., 100% for invasive carcinoma, 10% for carcinoma in situ).
> 8. For Self Bill CI policies (Day 1 processing):
>   8.1 System accepts manual Face Value input without validation.
>   8.2 System uses certificate policy instead of master policy for Face Value retrieval.
> 9. System calculates dependent Face Value using member's Covered Earnings as multiplier when policy is configured accordingly.
> 10. System applies age-based reductions to Term Life Face Value based on member's age at death when policy terms specify reduction schedules.


**Acceptance Criteria:**

> 1. **Given** a Term Life member coverage claim with range value benefit type, **when** the claims examiner accesses Face Value, **then** the system retrieves the value from the certificate policy and stores it as benefitAmount within min/max/increment constraints.
> 2. **Given** a Term Life member coverage with salary multiple structure, **when** Face Value is calculated, **then** the system computes (Annual Earnings × Salary Multiple) with appropriate rounding and stores as benefitAmount.
> 3. **Given** a Term Life policy with Core and Buyup components, **when** Face Value is derived, **then** the system combines both amounts to determine total Face Value stored as benefitAmount.
> 4. **Given** a Term Life spouse coverage with percentage-based structure, **when** Face Value is calculated, **then** the system computes MIN(Employee Percentage × Approved Amount, Maximum Benefit) and stores as benefitAmount.
> 5. **Given** a Critical Illness individual coverage claim with range values, **when** Face Value is retrieved, **then** the system obtains the value from certificate policy constrained by Guaranteed Issue Amount and stores as approvedAmount.
> 6. **Given** a CI individual coverage **when** Age Reduction is enabled **and** primary insured age ≥ CI Reduction Age, **then** the system applies Formula FV001 to reduce the Face Value.
> 7. **Given** a CI spouse coverage with percentage-based structure **when** Age Reduction is enabled **and** primary insured age ≥ CI Reduction Age, **then** the system applies Formula FV002 to calculate reduced Face Value.
> 8. **Given** a CI child coverage with percentage-based structure **when** Age Reduction is enabled **and** primary insured age ≥ CI Reduction Age, **then** the system applies Formula FV001 to calculate reduced Face Value and stores as childBenefitAmount.
> 9. **Given** a CI claim with scheduled items, **when** benefit amounts are calculated, **then** the system applies the appropriate percentage or flat amount formula referencing the Face Value (e.g., 100% for invasive carcinoma, 10% for carcinoma in situ).
> 10. **Given** a Self Bill CI policy claim on Day 1, **when** Face Value is entered, **then** the system accepts manual input without validation and retrieves Face Value from certificate policy instead of master policy.
> 11. **Given** a Term Life dependent claim with salary multiple structure, **when** Face Value is calculated, **then** the system computes the value using member's Covered Earnings as multiplier according to policy configuration.
> 12. **Given** a Term Life member coverage claim **when** age reduction applies, **then** the system reduces Face Value based on member's age at death according to policy reduction schedule.
> 13. **Given** a CI child coverage with single value benefit type, **when** Face Value is requested, **then** retrieval is not performed (out of scope exception).
> 14. **Given** a Term Life dependent coverage claim (spouse or child), **when** Face Value exceeds maximum of employee coverage, **then** the system caps the Face Value at the defined maximum and stores as benefitAmount.
> 15. **Given** any Face Value calculation failure due to missing policy data, **when** the claims examiner attempts to derive Face Value, **then** the system displays an error message identifying the missing data element and prevents claim progression.

#### Feature: As a Claims Adjuster, I want to apply age reduction rules to face value calculations when the insured reaches the policy-defined reduction age, so that benefit amounts are adjusted according to policy age reduction provisions.
- **Role**: Claims Adjuster
- **Action**: apply age reduction rules to face value calculations when the insured reaches the policy-defined reduction age
- **Value**: benefit amounts are adjusted according to policy age reduction provisions

**Description:**

> **As a** Claims Adjuster,
> **I want to** apply age reduction rules to face value calculations when the insured reaches the policy-defined reduction age,
> **so that** benefit amounts are adjusted according to policy age reduction provisions.


**Key Capabilities:**

> [
>   "1. System retrieves Face Value from the applicable Individual Policy based on coverage type (CI Individual, CI Spouse, CI Child, Term Life Individual, Spouse, Child).",
>   "2. For CI Individual Coverage, system retrieves the Approved Amount from Individual Policy (CIBenefitStructureIndividual.approvedAmount) constrained by Master Policy parameters (Minimum/Maximum Benefit Amount, Increment, Guaranteed Issue Amount).",
>   "3. For CI Spouse Coverage, system handles two calculation methods:",
>   "   3.1. Range Values: Retrieves Approved Amount from Individual Policy (CIBenefitStructureSpouse.approvedAmount) per Master Policy constraints; age reduction does NOT apply.",
>   "   3.2. Percentage of Individual Amount: Retrieves Approved Amount and applies Master Policy-defined percentage; age reduction applies when conditions are met.",
>   "4. For CI Child Coverage, system handles two calculation methods:",
>   "   4.1. Single Value: Retrieves Child Benefit Amount from Individual Policy (CIBenefitStructureChild.childBenefitAmount); age reduction does NOT apply.",
>   "   4.2. Percentage of Individual Amount: Calculates based on percentage of employee coverage; age reduction applies when conditions are met.",
>   "5. System evaluates age reduction applicability by checking:",
>   "   5.1. CICoverageDefinition.isAgeReductionApplied flag is set to 'Yes'.",
>   "   5.2. Age of primary insured at time of claim is greater than or equal to the age defined in CIAgeReduction.ageCd.",
>   "6. When age reduction applies to CI Individual Coverage, system calculates Face Value using Formula FV001 instead of directly using the Approved Amount from Individual Policy.",
>   "7. When age reduction applies to CI Spouse Coverage (Percentage of Individual Amount), system calculates Face Value using Formula FV002, which adjusts the percentage-based derivation.",
>   "8. When age reduction applies to CI Child Coverage (Percentage of Individual Amount), system calculates Face Value using Formula FV001 instead of standard percentage calculation.",
>   "9. System applies the calculated Face Value to downstream benefit calculations:",
>   "   9.1. Death Coverage amounts for Member or Dependent deaths.",
>   "   9.2. Accelerated Death Benefit (ADB) derived as percentage of Term Life Face Value.",
>   "   9.3. CI Scheduled Items where each item may be flat amount or formula-derived from Face Value.",
>   "10. For Term Life policies, system supports multiple Face Value determination methods (Range Values, Multiple Values, Single Value, Multiple of Salary) with appropriate retrieval from Individual Policy per Master Policy constraints.",
>   "11. System maintains distinction between Core amount (provided by PlanHolder) and Buyup amount (optional amount purchased by Member), combining both when Member purchases additional coverage.",
>   "12. Calculated Face Value serves as the upper limit for claim-level benefits, ensuring all derived coverages and scheduled items do not exceed policy provisions."
> ]


**Acceptance Criteria:**

> [
>   "1. **Given** a CI Individual Coverage claim where isAgeReductionApplied = 'Yes' and primary insured age ≥ CIAgeReduction.ageCd, **When** Face Value is calculated, **Then** the system applies Formula FV001 and does not use the raw Approved Amount.",
>   "2. **Given** a CI Individual Coverage claim where isAgeReductionApplied = 'No' or primary insured age &lt; CIAgeReduction.ageCd, **When** Face Value is calculated, **Then** the system retrieves the Approved Amount directly from CIBenefitStructureIndividual.approvedAmount without age reduction.",
&gt;   "3. **Given** a CI Spouse Coverage (Range Values) claim, **When** Face Value is calculated, **Then** age reduction is NOT applied regardless of primary insured age or configuration.",
>   "4. **Given** a CI Spouse Coverage (Percentage of Individual Amount) claim where isAgeReductionApplied = 'Yes' and primary insured age ≥ CIAgeReduction.ageCd, **When** Face Value is calculated, **Then** the system applies Formula FV002 to adjust the percentage-based calculation.",
>   "5. **Given** a CI Child Coverage (Single Value) claim, **When** Face Value is calculated, **Then** age reduction is NOT applied and system retrieves the flat Child Benefit Amount directly.",
>   "6. **Given** a CI Child Coverage (Percentage of Individual Amount) claim where isAgeReductionApplied = 'Yes' and primary insured age ≥ CIAgeReduction.ageCd, **When** Face Value is calculated, **Then** the system applies Formula FV001 instead of standard percentage calculation.",
>   "7. **Given** a claim with Member buyup coverage, **When** Face Value is determined, **Then** the system combines both Core amount and Buyup amount to calculate total Face Value.",
>   "8. **Given** a calculated Face Value with age reduction applied, **When** downstream benefits (Death Coverage, ADB, CI Scheduled Items) are calculated, **Then** all derived amounts use the age-reduced Face Value as the basis.",
>   "9. **Given** a CI policy with Face Value of $25,000 and age reduction reducing it to $15,000, **When** a Scheduled Item configured at 10% is calculated, **Then** the benefit amount is $1,500 (10% of $15,000), not $2,500.",
>   "10. **Given** multiple coverage types on the same policy (Individual, Spouse, Child), **When** age reduction is evaluated, **Then** the system applies reduction rules independently per coverage type based on each type's specific configuration.",
>   "11. **Given** a Term Life policy with Face Value determination method set to 'Multiple of Salary', **When** age reduction applies, **Then** the system first calculates Face Value from Annual Earnings × Salary Multiple with appropriate rounding, then applies age reduction formula.",
>   "12. **Given** an invalid or missing CIAgeReduction.ageCd configuration where isAgeReductionApplied = 'Yes', **When** system evaluates age reduction, **Then** the system logs an error and does not apply age reduction, using standard Face Value calculation.",
>   "13. **Given** a claim processed for a primary insured exactly at the reduction age threshold (age = CIAgeReduction.ageCd), **When** Face Value is calculated, **Then** age reduction is applied as the condition is 'greater than or equal to'.",
>   "14. **Given** Face Value retrieval from Master Policy for Self Bill CI Policies, **When** the coverage type is not Child Single Value, **Then** the system retrieves Face Value from Individual Certificate Policy as Master Policy retrieval is not supported.",
>   "15. **Given** calculated Face Value exceeds Master Policy Maximum Benefit Amount constraints, **When** validation is performed, **Then** the system flags the discrepancy and applies the Master Policy maximum as the upper limit."

#### Feature: As a System Administrator, I want to configure unverified policy attributes (coverage code, benefit code, incident date, date range, applicable loss types), so that claims can be processed for policies not yet integrated with the policy system.
- **Role**: System Administrator
- **Action**: configure unverified policy attributes (coverage code, benefit code, incident date, date range, applicable loss types)
- **Value**: claims can be processed for policies not yet integrated with the policy system

**Description:**

> **As a** System Administrator,
> **I want to** configure unverified policy attributes (coverage code, benefit code, incident date, date range, applicable loss types),
> **so that** claims can be processed for policies not yet integrated with the policy system.


**Key Capabilities:**

> 1. System Administrator accesses the policy system foundation configuration module to define unverified policy attribute templates.
> 2. Administrator configures coverage codes that represent policy coverage types not yet synchronized from the policy administration system.
> 3. Administrator defines benefit codes that map to coverage benefits available for claims processing without full policy integration.
> 4. Administrator establishes incident date and date range parameters that determine temporal validity for claims against unverified policies.
> 5. Administrator specifies applicable loss types that can be associated with each unverified policy configuration to enable proper claim routing and adjudication.
> 6. System validates configured attributes against integration specification rules maintained in the authoritative documentation.
>    6.1. If configuration conflicts with documented integration specifications (such as dental certificate and master policy integration rules), system displays validation errors.
>    6.2. Administrator reviews and corrects configuration based on the master Google Spreadsheet or wiki-attached Excel documentation.
> 7. Administrator saves the unverified policy attribute configuration, making it available for claims processing workflows.
> 8. Claims processing system utilizes configured unverified attributes when evaluating claims for policies not yet fully integrated, applying the rules engine logic based on administrator-defined parameters.
> 9. Administrator maintains synchronization between system configuration and policy integration specifications by referencing the master Google Spreadsheet and versioned wiki attachments.
>    9.1. When integration specifications are updated (new features affecting dental certificates and master policies), Administrator reviews the updated documentation.
>    9.2. Administrator updates unverified policy attribute configurations to reflect changes in the authoritative Google Sheet.


**Acceptance Criteria:**

> 1. **Given** the System Administrator has appropriate permissions, **When** they access the policy system foundation configuration module, **Then** the unverified policy attributes configuration interface is available.
> 2. **Given** the Administrator is configuring coverage codes, **When** they define a new coverage code with required parameters, **Then** the system saves the coverage code and makes it available for claims processing.
> 3. **Given** the Administrator is configuring benefit codes, **When** they associate benefit codes with coverage codes and loss types, **Then** the system validates the relationship and persists the configuration.
> 4. **Given** the Administrator defines incident date parameters, **When** they specify date ranges for policy validity, **Then** the system enforces these date constraints during claims evaluation.
> 5. **Given** the Administrator configures applicable loss types, **When** they assign loss types to unverified policy attributes, **Then** the claims processing system correctly routes claims based on the configured loss type mappings.
> 6. **Given** configured attributes conflict with documented integration specifications, **When** the Administrator attempts to save the configuration, **Then** the system displays specific validation errors referencing the authoritative documentation.
> 7. **Given** the policy integration specifications have been updated in the master Google Spreadsheet, **When** the Administrator reviews the wiki-attached Excel export (Dental Certificate and Master Policy Integration.xlsx), **Then** they can identify required changes to unverified policy attribute configurations.
> 8. **Given** a claim is submitted for a policy not yet integrated, **When** the claims processing system evaluates the claim, **Then** the system applies the configured unverified policy attributes (coverage codes, benefit codes, date ranges, loss types) according to the rules engine logic.
> 9. **Given** the Administrator has saved unverified policy attribute configurations, **When** they navigate away and return to the configuration interface, **Then** all previously saved configurations are accurately displayed and editable.
> 10. **Given** the integration documentation (Google Spreadsheet or wiki Excel attachment) serves as the single source of truth, **When** the Administrator configures unverified attributes, **Then** the system provides reference links or inline help pointing to the authoritative documentation for validation guidance.
> 11. **Given** multiple administrators may update configurations, **When** an Administrator saves changes to unverified policy attributes, **Then** the system logs the change with timestamp and user identification for audit purposes.
> 12. **Given** unverified policy attributes are configured incorrectly, **When** claims processing attempts to use these attributes, **Then** the system handles errors gracefully and provides diagnostic information referencing the misconfigured attribute.

#### Feature: As a Claims Operations Manager, I want the system to automatically populate policy information into event cases, claims, and settlements during creation commands, so that policy data is consistently enriched without manual intervention.
- **Role**: Claims Operations Manager
- **Action**: automatically populate policy information into event cases, claims, and settlements during creation commands
- **Value**: policy data is consistently enriched without manual intervention

**Description:**

> **As a** Claims Operations Manager,
> **I want to** automatically populate policy information into event cases, claims, and settlements during creation commands,
> **so that** policy data is consistently enriched without manual intervention.


**Key Capabilities:**

> 1. System initiates automatic policy population during creation commands for Event Cases, Claims, and Settlements.
> 2. For Event Case creation:
>    2.1 System checks if policy data exists on SinglePolicyHolder or CapPolicyHolder during createCase command execution.
>    2.2 If policy data is null, system invokes CapEventCasePolicyPopulator to search for applicable policies using Event Date as the search parameter.
>    2.3 System routes retrieved policy data through CapEventCasePolicyInfo transformation to map external policy model to CAP entity structure.
>    2.4 If policy data already exists, system skips population step and proceeds with existing data.
> 3. For Disability Claim creation:
>    3.1 System checks policy data during createLoss command execution.
>    3.2 If policy data is null, system invokes CapDisabilityPolicyPopulator using lossDetail.lastWorkDate as search parameter.
>    3.3 System resolves policy version by matching capPolicyVersionId for versioned policies, or by matching capPolicyId with effective date range filtering for non-versioned policies.
>    3.4 System applies transformation based on claim model (CapStd, CapLtd, CapSmp, CapLeave) to populate disability-specific policy information.
>    3.5 For STD products, system uses extended naming convention that includes packageCd to differentiate between STD and LTD packages.
> 4. For Life Claim creation:
>    4.1 System checks policy data during createLoss command execution.
>    4.2 If policy data is null, system invokes CapClaimWrapperPolicyPopulator using lossDetail.claimLossDate as search parameter.
>    4.3 System applies same version resolution logic as disability claims.
>    4.4 System applies transformation based on policy model (ACC, CI, HI, TL, PL) to populate life-specific policy information.
> 5. For Settlement adjudication:
>    5.1 System triggers policy population during adjudicateSettlement command execution.
>    5.2 System applies policy-to-settlement transformations specific to settlement type (Disability: CapStdSettlement, CapLtdSettlement, CapSmpSettlement, CapLeaveSettlement; Life: AcceleratedSettlement, DeathSettlement, CISettlement, HISettlement, AccidentalDismembermentSettlement, PremiumWaiverSettlement).
>    5.3 For STD settlements, system uses packageCd prefix in transformation naming.
> 6. System routes policy data through parent transformations that dynamically select specific sub-transformations based on Policy Product/Model Name.
> 7. For unverified or external policies:
>    7.1 System uses specialized unverified policy transformations (CapEventCaseUnverifiedPolicy, CapDisabilityUnverifiedPolicy, CapLifeUnverifiedPolicy).
>    7.2 System marks unverified policies with (UP) indicator for tracking and reporting purposes.
> 8. System maintains transformation files organized by domain and model type to support multiple policy products across Life and Disability lines of business.


**Acceptance Criteria:**

> 1. **Given** an Event Case is being created **and** policy data is null on the policy holder, **when** the createCase command executes, **then** the system invokes CapEventCasePolicyPopulator using Event Date and populates policy information within the Event Case entity.
> 2. **Given** an Event Case is being created **and** policy data already exists on the policy holder, **when** the createCase command executes, **then** the system skips the policy population step and proceeds without invoking the policy populator.
> 3. **Given** a Disability Claim is being created for a versioned policy, **when** the createLoss command executes, **then** the system matches the policy by capPolicyVersionId and applies the appropriate transformation based on claim model.
> 4. **Given** a Disability Claim is being created for a non-versioned policy, **when** the createLoss command executes, **then** the system matches the policy by capPolicyId with effective date range (effTxEffectiveDate &lt;= searchDate &lt;= effTxExpirationDate) and selects the most recent version by sorting policySystemRevisionNo in descending order.
> 5. **Given** a Life Claim is being created, **when** the createLoss command executes with lossDetail.claimLossDate, **then** the system invokes CapClaimWrapperPolicyPopulator and applies the correct policy-to-claim transformation (ACC, CI, HI, TL, or PL).
> 6. **Given** an STD product claim or settlement is being processed, **when** transformation naming is resolved, **then** the system uses the extended naming convention &lt;Policy.packageCd&gt;&lt;Policy._modelName&gt;To[Target] instead of the standard pattern.
> 7. **Given** a Settlement is being adjudicated, **when** the adjudicateSettlement command executes, **then** the system applies the policy-to-settlement transformation specific to the settlement model (e.g., AcceleratedSettlementInfo for AcceleratedSettlement).
> 8. **Given** a policy cannot be verified or is external/unverified, **when** policy population is triggered, **then** the system uses the appropriate Unverified Policy transformation and marks it with (UP) indicator.
> 9. **Given** multiple policy models are supported across Life and Disability products, **when** policy data is retrieved, **then** the parent transformation routes to the specific sub-transformation based on Policy Product/Model Name without manual intervention.
> 10. **Given** transformation files are organized by domain (EventCase/Claim/Settlement) and model type, **when** a policy population is triggered, **then** the system locates and applies the correct transformation from the appropriate file location (/cap-case-hna-domain, /cap-loss-disability-domain, /cap-loss-term-life-domain, /cap-adjudication-disability-domain, or /cap-adjudication-term-life-domain).
> 11. **Given** policy data is missing or invalid during command execution, **when** the policy populator cannot retrieve applicable policies, **then** the system prevents entity creation and returns an error indicating policy information is required.
> 12. **Given** policy effective dates do not cover the search date (Event Date, lastWorkDate, or claimLossDate), **when** policy search is executed, **then** the system does not populate policy data and handles the case as unverified or out-of-coverage.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

> 1. **Given** a user initiates case creation and selects a Subject of Claim with existing cases, **When** the system evaluates duplicate case rules, **Then** the system calculates scores for all matching cases and displays duplicate warning popup if any case score meets or exceeds the configured threshold value.
> 2. **Given** duplicate cases are detected during case creation, **When** the user clicks 'No' button in the popup dialog, **Then** the system closes the modal, cancels case creation, and returns user to Case Detail page without creating the case.
> 3. **Given** duplicate cases are detected during case creation, **When** the user clicks 'Yes' button in the popup dialog, **Then** the system closes the modal and proceeds to Additional Parties page allowing case creation to continue.
> 4. **Given** a case is submitted via Complete Intake or portal submission, **When** duplicate case validation detects cases meeting or exceeding threshold score, **Then** the system displays warning alert on Case Overview page with 'View Duplication Details' hyperlink.
> 5. **Given** a warning alert is displayed on Case Overview page, **When** the user clicks 'View Duplication Details' hyperlink, **Then** the system opens Duplication Details drawer showing all cases with scores at or above threshold value including score breakdowns.
> 6. **Given** duplicate cases are flagged on Case Overview page, **When** the user clicks 'Override Duplication Result' button, **Then** the system marks the override flag as true and suppresses future duplicate case validation for this case during updates.
> 7. **Given** a claim is created after case submission, **When** the system finds existing claims across all cases matching Subject of Claim, Claim Type, and Policy Number with total score at or above threshold, **Then** the system marks the claim as Non-Eligible and displays error message with 'View Duplication Details' hyperlink.
> 8. **Given** a duplicate claim is flagged for GTL/CI/HI/ACC/IPL policy types, **When** the eligibility validation completes, **Then** the system displays claim-level error message under the claim header.
> 9. **Given** a duplicate claim is flagged for STD/LTD/SMP policy types, **When** the eligibility validation completes, **Then** the system displays settlement-level error message in the Coverages table.
> 10. **Given** a duplicate claim error is displayed, **When** the user clicks 'View Duplication Details' hyperlink, **Then** the system opens Score Details drawer showing all claims with scores at or above threshold value including detailed scoring breakdown.
> 11. **Given** a user manually creates a claim via 'Create New Claim', **When** duplicate claims are detected meeting or exceeding threshold score, **Then** the system displays popup dialog with Yes/No confirmation buttons.
> 12. **Given** duplicate claims are detected during manual claim creation, **When** the user clicks 'No' button, **Then** the system closes the modal, cancels claim creation, and returns user to Case Overview page without creating the claim.
> 13. **Given** duplicate claims are detected during manual claim creation, **When** the user clicks 'Yes' button, **Then** the system creates the claim, navigates to Claim Overview page, marks claim as Non-Eligible, and displays error message with 'View Duplication Details' hyperlink.
> 14. **Given** an existing case is updated via case edit functionality, **When** the 'Override Duplication Result' flag is false, **Then** the system re-triggers both case duplicate validation and claim duplicate validation using the same scoring logic.
> 15. **Given** an existing case is updated via case edit functionality, **When** the 'Override Duplication Result' flag is true, **Then** the system does not trigger case duplicate validation.
> 16. **Given** an existing claim is updated manually or via readjudication, **When** the duplicate eligibility rule has not been overridden to Eligible, **Then** the system re-triggers claim duplicate validation using the same scoring logic.
> 17. **Given** an existing claim is updated manually or via readjudication, **When** the duplicate eligibility rule has been previously overridden to Eligible, **Then** the system does not trigger claim duplicate validation.
> 18. **Given** duplicate validation rules are configured in BR>Duplicate Case/Claim Validation, **When** the system evaluates any case or claim, **Then** the system initializes score at 0, evaluates each rule sequentially, adds the rule's score value if TRUE, and compares final sum to threshold value.
> 19. **Given** a GTL/CI/HI/ACC/IPL/STD/LTD/SMP policy is active for the Subject of Claim, **When** duplicate validation is triggered, **Then** the system performs validation according to policy type-specific rules and displays errors at appropriate level (claim-level or settlement-level).

#### Feature: As a Claims Examiner, I want to evaluate event case applicability against policy versions and business rules, so that the system can automatically create only applicable claims based on the intake data.
- **Role**: Claims Examiner
- **Action**: evaluate event case applicability against policy versions and business rules
- **Value**: the system can automatically create only applicable claims based on the intake data

**Description:**

> **As a** Claims Examiner,
> **I want to** evaluate event case applicability against policy versions and business rules,
> **so that** the system can automatically create only applicable claims based on the intake data.


**Key Capabilities:**

> 1. System evaluates event case data against active policy versions to determine coverage applicability based on loss date, insured member, and product type.
> 2. Business rules engine applies product-specific and market-specific adjudication rules to assess whether the event qualifies for claim creation under each applicable policy.
> 3. System executes auto-adjudication flow to automatically validate eligibility criteria including:
>    3.1 Policy status and effective dates at the time of loss
>    3.2 Coverage provisions and limitations specific to the type of event reported
>    3.3 Waiting periods, elimination periods, and benefit eligibility conditions
>    3.4 Product-specific rules for Long Term Disability, Short Term Disability, and Accident Claims
> 4. Upon successful applicability validation, system automatically creates claims for all applicable policies and products without manual intervention.
> 5. System maintains bidirectional traceability linking the event case to all auto-created claims, enabling users to navigate between related entities.
> 6. For cases where applicability cannot be automatically determined:
>    6.1 System flags the event case for manual review by the Claims Examiner
>    6.2 System provides detailed reasoning and missing information needed for adjudication
> 7. System records all applicability evaluation outcomes, including passed and failed rule conditions, for audit and troubleshooting purposes.
> 8. Upon completion of applicability evaluation and claim creation, system routes the event case to the appropriate workflow stage (e.g., Case Overview, pending manual review, or auto-adjudication complete).


**Acceptance Criteria:**

> 1. **Given** an event case is submitted with complete intake data, **when** the system evaluates applicability, **then** all active policy versions for the insured member effective on the loss date are identified within 5 seconds.
> 2. **Given** a policy version is identified as potentially applicable, **when** business rules are executed, **then** product-specific adjudication rules (LTD, STD, Accident) are applied based on the claim type indicated in the event case.
> 3. **Given** all applicability criteria are met for a policy, **when** auto-adjudication completes, **then** the system automatically creates a claim record linked to the event case without manual intervention.
> 4. **Given** a single event case applies to multiple policy versions, **when** applicability evaluation completes, **then** the system creates separate claims for each applicable policy and maintains traceability to the originating event case.
> 5. **Given** applicability evaluation determines no policies qualify, **when** the evaluation completes, **then** the system does not create any claims and flags the event case with status indicating 'No Applicable Coverage' with detailed reasoning.
> 6. **Given** an event case has incomplete or ambiguous data, **when** auto-adjudication runs, **then** the system halts automatic claim creation and routes the case for manual Claims Examiner review with specific data gaps identified.
> 7. **Given** market-specific or product-specific rules exist, **when** applicability is evaluated, **then** the correct rule set is applied based on the policy's jurisdiction and product configuration.
> 8. **Given** applicability evaluation is complete, **when** the Claims Examiner accesses the event case, **then** the system displays all evaluation outcomes, including which policies were assessed, which rules passed or failed, and which claims were auto-created.
> 9. **Given** a claim creation timing rule exists for a product (e.g., LTD/PW claim creation timing), **when** applicability is determined, **then** the system respects the configured timing rules and creates claims according to the specified schedule.
> 10. **Given** an error occurs during auto-adjudication or claim creation, **when** the system encounters the failure, **then** the event case remains in a recoverable state, the error is logged with sufficient detail for troubleshooting, and no partial claims are created.

#### Feature: As a Claims Examiner, I want to add and manage additional parties (with roles and contact information) to an event case during intake, so that all relevant parties are documented for claim processing.
- **Role**: Claims Examiner
- **Action**: add and manage additional parties (with roles and contact information) to an event case during intake
- **Value**: all relevant parties are documented for claim processing

**Description:**

> **As a** Claims Examiner,
> **I want to** add and manage additional parties (with roles and contact information) to an event case during intake,
> **so that** all relevant parties are documented for claim processing.


**Key Capabilities:**

> 1. Claims Examiner accesses the Additional Parties section as part of the multi-step Case Intake wizard (Step 3: Additional Parties).
> 2. Examiner adds parties to the event case by capturing key identifying information including party type, role, name, and contact details (phone, email, address).
> 3. System allows assignment of specific party roles relevant to the event type (e.g., claimant, beneficiary, witness, healthcare provider, employer representative).
> 4. Examiner can add multiple parties with different roles to a single event case as needed for comprehensive documentation.
> 5. System validates that required party information is complete before allowing progression or submission.
> 6. Examiner can edit or remove party information while the case remains in draft or incomplete status.
> 7. Upon case submission via 'Complete Intake', all party information is saved and becomes part of the permanent event case record.
> 8. Party information is made available for downstream claim processing, correspondence generation, and workflow routing.
>
>    8.1 **Alternate Flow - Event Type ADA Work Accommodation**: If the selected event type is ADA - Work Accommodation, the system skips additional information collection requirements and allows progression without mandatory party-specific data entry beyond basic case parties.


**Acceptance Criteria:**

> 1. **Given** the Claims Examiner is on Step 3 (Additional Parties) of the Case Intake wizard, **When** they add a new party, **Then** the system requires at minimum: party role and contact name before allowing save.
> 2. **Given** an event case is in draft status, **When** the Examiner adds multiple parties with different roles, **Then** all parties are saved and displayed in the party list with their assigned roles clearly indicated.
> 3. **Given** the Examiner has entered party information, **When** they click 'Save & Exit', **Then** all party data is persisted and retrievable when the case is reopened within 30 days.
> 4. **Given** required party information is incomplete, **When** the Examiner attempts to click 'Complete Intake', **Then** the system blocks submission and displays inline error messages identifying missing required fields.
> 5. **Given** the event type is ADA - Work Accommodation, **When** the Examiner reaches the additional information step, **Then** the system skips mandatory additional party collection and allows progression to case completion.
> 6. **Given** the Examiner is viewing the Additional Parties section, **When** they edit an existing party's information, **Then** the system saves the updated information and reflects changes immediately in the party list.
> 7. **Given** a party has been added to the case, **When** the Examiner removes the party before case submission, **Then** the system removes the party from the case record without affecting other saved information.
> 8. **Given** the Examiner completes intake with all required party information, **When** the case is submitted, **Then** all party data is available on the Event Case Overview screen and accessible for downstream claim processing workflows.

#### Feature: As a Claims Adjuster, I want to capture case details including reporting method, event date, and loss type during intake, so that all essential claim information is recorded accurately
- **Role**: Claims Adjuster
- **Action**: capture case details including reporting method, event date, and loss type during intake
- **Value**: all essential claim information is recorded accurately

**Description:**

> **As a** Claims Adjuster,
> **I want to** capture case details including reporting method, event date, and loss type during intake,
> **so that** all essential claim information is recorded accurately.


**Key Capabilities:**

> 1. Adjuster captures core case details including reporting method (via dropdown), date reported (date picker with past/current date validation), event date (required, validated against earliest event loss date), and optional event description (up to 1000 characters).
>    1.1 If reporting method is 'Self-service portal', the Date Reported field is automatically disabled.
>    1.2 If Event Date is later than the earliest event loss date, the system displays a warning but allows the adjuster to continue.
> 2. Adjuster selects the claim subject from eligible parties including the member and active dependents (Wife, Husband, Domestic Partner, Daughter, Son) retrieved from CEM data.
>    2.1 If the required party is not listed, adjuster selects 'Other' and is navigated to 'Add New Individual Party' slide-out panel to enter party details and relationship to member; upon saving, the subject section refreshes and the newly added party is auto-selected.
> 3. Adjuster classifies the case by selecting Accident, Sickness, or Other using radio button options.
> 4. Adjuster selects applicable loss types from multi-select options: Death, Accident, Serious Illness, Absence, Accelerated Death, Hospital Service, ADA - Work Accommodation, and Wellness.
>    4.1 If the selected subject is not the employee, the 'Absence' loss type checkbox is automatically disabled.
> 5. Adjuster optionally manages ICD codes by adding, editing, or deleting entries with code, description, primary indicator (checkbox), and date fields.
>    5.1 If the adjuster attempts to mark multiple ICD Codes as primary, a validation error is triggered (only one primary allowed).
>    5.2 If the adjuster attempts to delete an ICD Code entry, a confirmation modal is displayed to prevent accidental removal.
> 6. Adjuster navigates through the intake workflow using Next (to Step 3: Additional Parties), Previous (back to Step 1: Member), Save & Exit (persist data and exit), or Cancel (terminate without saving changes).


**Acceptance Criteria:**

> 1. **Given** the adjuster is on Step 2 of the intake process, **when** they select a reporting method and enter a date reported, **then** the date reported must be validated as current or past date.
> 2. **Given** the reporting method is 'Self-service portal', **when** the page loads, **then** the Date Reported field is automatically disabled and cannot be manually edited.
> 3. **Given** the adjuster enters an event date, **when** the date is later than the earliest event loss date, **then** the system displays a warning message but allows continuation to the next step.
> 4. **Given** the adjuster is selecting a claim subject, **when** they choose 'Other', **then** they are navigated to the 'Add New Individual Party' slide-out panel, and upon saving, the newly added party is auto-selected as the claim subject.
> 5. **Given** the adjuster has selected a subject who is not the employee, **when** the loss types are displayed, **then** the 'Absence' checkbox is automatically disabled.
> 6. **Given** the adjuster is managing ICD codes, **when** they attempt to mark more than one ICD Code as primary, **then** a validation error is triggered and the action is blocked.
> 7. **Given** the adjuster attempts to delete an ICD Code, **when** they click the delete action, **then** a confirmation modal is displayed before the deletion is executed.
> 8. **Given** the adjuster has entered all required fields (reporting method, event date, and accident/sickness classification), **when** they click 'Next', **then** they are navigated to Step 3: Additional Parties.

#### Feature: As a Claims Adjuster, I want to add and manage parties (claimants, beneficiaries, vendors) to a case, so that all stakeholders are properly documented and linked to the claim
- **Role**: Claims Adjuster
- **Action**: add and manage parties (claimants, beneficiaries, vendors) to a case and assign specific claim roles and relationships
- **Value**: all stakeholders are properly documented, linked to the claim, and their roles and contact information are accurately maintained throughout the case lifecycle

**Description:**

> **As a** Claims Adjuster,
> **I want to** add and manage parties (claimants, beneficiaries, vendors) to a case and assign specific claim roles and relationships,
> **so that** all stakeholders are properly documented, linked to the claim, and their roles and contact information are accurately maintained throughout the case lifecycle.


**Key Capabilities:**

> 1. System displays the Additional Party Information table showing all parties currently associated with the case.
> 2. Adjuster initiates party addition by searching for existing parties in the system.
>    2.1 Search auto-triggers when more than 3 characters are entered, displaying matching results with party names.
>    2.2 Adjuster can apply advanced filters to refine search results.
>    2.3 Adjuster can view detailed party information from search results before making a selection.
>    2.4 If no matching party is found, adjuster can manually create a new party record with required information.
> 3. Adjuster selects a party from search results and assigns claim-specific roles and relationship to participant.
> 4. System adds the party to the case and displays the updated party record in the Additional Party Information table.
> 5. Adjuster edits contact information for added parties including addresses and communication details.
>    5.1 System updates contact information in the backend and reflects changes in the party table.
> 6. Adjuster edits party information including roles, relationships to insured, and payment methods.
>    6.1 For parties with protected roles (Employer, Primary Beneficiary, Contingent Beneficiary, Payee, Guardian), system restricts role modification to maintain data integrity.
>    6.2 Guardian roles cannot be selected from the role dropdown when editing existing party records.
>    6.3 System updates party information and refreshes the display with current data.
> 7. System requires confirmation when adjuster attempts to cancel party addition or edit operations to prevent accidental data loss.
> 8. Adjuster can remove or reassign parties as case requirements change, subject to role-based restrictions.


**Acceptance Criteria:**

> 1. **Given** the adjuster is on the Additional Parties screen,
>    **When** they click 'Add Party',
>    **Then** the system opens the Add Party interface with search functionality enabled.
>
> 2. **Given** the adjuster is entering search criteria,
>    **When** they type more than 3 characters,
>    **Then** the system automatically displays auto-suggest results showing party first and last names within 2 seconds.
>
> 3. **Given** the adjuster has selected a party from search results,
>    **When** they assign roles and relationship to participant and save,
>    **Then** the system creates a new record in the Additional Party Information table and displays edit options.
>
> 4. **Given** no matching party is found in search results,
>    **When** the adjuster chooses to add a new party manually,
>    **Then** the system opens the Add New Party form, allows data entry, and creates the party record upon submission.
>
> 5. **Given** an existing party record is displayed in the party table,
>    **When** the adjuster clicks 'Edit Contact Information',
>    **Then** the system opens a slide-out window with current contact and address information editable and saveable.
>
> 6. **Given** an existing party record is displayed,

>    **Then** the system opens a slide-out window allowing updates to roles, relationships, and payment methods.
>    6.1 **Given** the party has a protected role (Employer, Primary Beneficiary, Contingent Beneficiary, Payee, Guardian),
>        **When** the adjuster opens the Edit Party form,
>        **Then** these role values are disabled and cannot be removed, and these roles do not appear in the Roles dropdown for selection.
>
> 7. **Given** the adjuster has a party with Guardian of Beneficiary role,
>    **When** they click 'Edit' on this party record,
>    **Then** the system displays the Guardian role as disabled and does not allow it to be found in the Roles dropdown.
>
> 8. **Given** the adjuster is in the process of adding or editing a party,
>    **When** they click 'Cancel',

>    8.2 **Given** the confirmation dialog is displayed,
>        **When** the adjuster does not confirm,
>        **Then** the system closes the dialog and returns to the form for continued editing.
>
> 9. **Given** the adjuster is viewing search results,
>    **When** they click on a party name to view details,
>    **Then** the system opens the Party Information UI in read-only mode and closes without confirmation when dismissed.
>
> 10. **Given** the adjuster applies search filters,
>     **When** they execute the filtered search,
>     **Then** the system displays only results matching all applied filter criteria.
>
> 11. **Given** the adjuster saves contact or party information updates,
>     **When** the save operation completes,
>     **Then** the system updates the backend, closes the edit window, and refreshes the Additional Party Information table to show updated data.
>
> 12. **Given** required fields are missing during party addition,
>     **When** the adjuster attempts to save,
>     **Then** the system prevents submission and displays inline validation errors.

- **Action**: create new claims from an event case using the 'I want to' menu
- **Value**: I can quickly initiate claims for different claim types (STD, SMP, LTD, Other) and ensure proper routing based on claim event and case status

**Description:**

> **As a** Claims Adjuster,
> **I want to** create new claims from an event case using the 'I want to' menu,
> **so that** I can quickly initiate claims for different claim types (STD, SMP, LTD, Other) and ensure proper routing based on claim event and case status.


**Key Capabilities:**

> 1. User views the Event Case Overview screen displaying the unique case number and current Event Case status.
> 2. User accesses the hierarchical 'I want to' menu system to initiate claim creation.
>   2.1 User clicks the 'I want to' button to display the 1st level menu.
>   2.2 User selects 'Create New Claim' from the 1st level menu to reveal the 2nd level menu.
> 3. System presents available claim type options in the 2nd level menu (Other Claim, STD Claim, SMP Claim, LTD Claim).
> 4. User selects a claim type and system navigates to the appropriate claim creation page.
>   4.1 For 'Other Claim' selection: System navigates to the Add New Claim page with no additional restrictions.
>   4.2 For 'STD Claim' selection: System validates Event Case contains Claim Event 'Absence' and status is 'Open', then navigates to the STD Claim page.
>   4.3 For 'SMP Claim' selection: System validates Event Case contains Claim Event 'Absence' and status is 'Open', then navigates to the SMP Claim page.
>   4.4 For 'LTD Claim' selection: System validates Event Case contains Claim Event 'Absence' and status is 'Open', then navigates to the LTD Claim page.
> 5. For absence-related claim types (STD, SMP, LTD), if business rule validation fails:
>   5.1 System disables the corresponding claim type button.
>   5.2 System displays contextual error message on hover explaining the restriction (either missing Claim Event 'Absence' or Event Case not in 'Open' status).


**Acceptance Criteria:**

> 1. **Given** a Claims Adjuster is authenticated with privilege 'PRIV>CAP>Initiate Loss' and viewing an Event Case Overview with status 'Open',
>    **When** the user clicks the 'I want to' button,
>    **Then** the system displays the 1st level menu within 1 second.
>
> 2. **Given** the 1st level menu is displayed,
>    **When** the user clicks 'Create New Claim',
>    **Then** the system displays the 2nd level menu showing all four claim type options (Other Claim, STD Claim, SMP Claim, LTD Claim).
>
> 3. **Given** the Event Case has status 'Open' and no specific claim event restriction,
>    **When** the user selects 'Other Claim',
>    **Then** the system navigates to the Add New Claim page for Other Claim type without validation errors.
>
> 4. **Given** the Event Case contains Claim Event 'Absence' and status is 'Open',
>    **When** the user selects 'STD Claim', 'SMP Claim', or 'LTD Claim',
>    **Then** the system navigates to the respective claim creation page (STD, SMP, or LTD).
>
> 5. **Given** the Event Case does NOT contain Claim Event 'Absence',
>    **When** the user views the claim type menu,
>    **Then** the system disables the STD Claim, SMP Claim, and LTD Claim buttons,
>    **And** hovering over each disabled button displays the message: '[Claim Type] can be created only when Claim Event 'Absence' is selected for the Event Case.'
>
> 6. **Given** the Event Case status is NOT 'Open' (e.g., 'Closed', 'Incomplete'),
>    **When** the user views the claim type menu,
>    **Then** the system disables the STD Claim, SMP Claim, and LTD Claim buttons,
>    **And** hovering over each disabled button displays the message: '[Claim Type] can be created only when Event Case is in status 'Open'.'
>
> 7. **Given** the user does NOT have privilege 'PRIV>CAP>Initiate Loss',
>    **When** the user attempts to access the Event Case Overview,
>    **Then** the 'I want to' menu functionality for claim creation is not available or disabled.
>
> 8. **Given** the Event Case does not contain Claim Event 'Absence' AND the status is NOT 'Open',
>    **When** the user hovers over a disabled absence-related claim button,

#### Feature: As a Claims Adjuster, I want to validate claim creation against policy effective periods and detect duplicate claims, so that invalid or duplicate claims are prevented from being created
- **Role**: Claims Adjuster
- **Action**: create a new claim linked to an existing case and policy with automatic validation of policy effective periods and duplicate claim detection
- **Value**: invalid claims outside policy coverage periods and duplicate claims are prevented or flagged before creation, reducing processing errors and operational costs

**Description:**

> **As a** Claims Adjuster,
> **I want to** create a new claim linked to an existing case and policy with automatic validation of policy effective periods and duplicate claim detection,
> **so that** invalid claims outside policy coverage periods and duplicate claims are prevented or flagged before creation, reducing processing errors and operational costs.


**Key Capabilities:**

> [
>   "1. User navigates to Case Overview and initiates the add new claim process for cases that have existing loss events.",
>   "2. User selects the type of claim from available insurance lines (Life, Critical Illness, Hospital Indemnity, Short-Term Disability, Semi-Monthly Disability, Long-Term Disability).",
>   "3. System dynamically filters available claim events and policies based on the selected claim type and product mappings.",
>   "4. User selects one or more existing claim events (Death, Accelerated Death, Accidental Dismemberment, Serious Illness, Absence, Hospital Service) associated with the case.",
>   "5. User selects a policy from the filtered list displaying policy number, line of business, effective date, and termination date.",
>   "6. System validates that the date of loss falls within the selected policy's effective period.",
>   "6.1. If date of loss is outside policy effective period, system prevents claim creation and alerts user to select a different policy or create claim without policy association.",
>   "6.2. If master policy is selected when individual policy exists, system prevents claim creation and prompts user to select appropriate individual policy.",
>   "7. System performs duplicate claim detection by searching for existing claims under the selected policy across all claim statuses.",
>   "7.1. If duplicate claim is detected, system displays warning modal identifying the existing claim and allows user to proceed or cancel.",
>   "7.2. If user confirms to proceed despite duplicate warning, system allows claim creation.",
>   "8. User optionally creates claim without policy association by enabling the 'Create Claim Without Policy' option, which bypasses policy validation.",
>   "9. User submits the claim creation request, triggering backend claim initiation and creation processes.",
>   "10. System confirms successful claim creation and displays the new claim on the Claim Overview page."
> ]


**Acceptance Criteria:**

> [
>   "**Positive Scenarios:**",
>   "1. Given a case with existing loss events, when the user accesses Case Overview, then the 'Add New Claim' button is enabled.",
>   "2. Given the user selects a claim type, when the selection is made, then the system filters claim events and policies to show only those applicable to the selected claim type within 2 seconds.",
>   "3. Given the user selects claim type 'Life', when viewing available claim events, then only Death, Accelerated Death, and Accidental Dismemberment events are displayed.",
>   "4. Given the user selects a claim event and policy, when the date of loss falls within the policy effective period, then the system allows the user to proceed to claim creation.",
>   "5. Given the user completes all mandatory fields with valid data, when the user clicks 'Create Claim', then the system creates the claim and displays success message 'Claim successfully created' on Claim Overview page within 5 seconds.",
>   "6. Given the user enables 'Create Claim Without Policy', when the user proceeds with claim creation, then the system bypasses policy validation and creates the claim without policy association.",
>   "7. Given multiple policies exist for the customer, when the policy list is displayed, then only the latest version of each policy is shown regardless of policy status.",
>   "8. Given policies are filtered based on employee/customer relationship, when group policies exist, then individual policies are shown for individual claims and group policies for group claims.",
>   "**Negative Scenarios:**",
>   "9. Given a case without existing loss events, when the user accesses Case Overview, then the 'Add New Claim' button is disabled.",
>   "10. Given the user selects a policy with effective period from 2023-01-01 to 2023-12-31, when the date of loss is 2024-02-15, then the system displays error: 'Date of Loss of the selected event is not within the chosen Policy's effective Period. Please select another policy or create claim without a policy' and prevents claim creation.",
>   "11. Given a claim already exists for the selected policy and loss event, when the user attempts to create a new claim, then the system displays warning modal: 'Claim already exists. This claim might be a duplicate of Claim #[number] under the same policy #[number]. Do you wish to proceed?' with Yes/No options.",
>   "12. Given the duplicate claim warning is displayed, when the user selects 'No', then the claim creation is cancelled and the user returns to the claim form without saving.",
>   "13. Given the user selects a master policy, when an individual policy exists for the same coverage, then the system displays error preventing claim creation and prompts user to select the individual policy.",
>   "14. Given the user is on the Add New Claim form, when the user clicks 'Cancel', then the system returns to Case Overview page without saving any entered data.",
>   "15. Given mandatory fields (Type of Claim, Select Existing Claim Event, Select Policy) are incomplete, when the user attempts to submit, then the system prevents claim creation and displays inline validation errors."

#### Feature: As a Claims Adjuster, I want to view case duplication warnings and override duplication results when appropriate, so that I can proceed with legitimate duplicate claims while maintaining audit trails
- **Role**: Claims Adjuster
- **Action**: view case duplication warnings, review matched duplicate cases with detailed scoring, and override duplication results when appropriate with documented justification
- **Value**: I can proceed with legitimate duplicate claims while maintaining audit trails and preventing false duplicate rejections that could delay valid claim processing

**Description:**

> **As a** Claims Adjuster,
> **I want to** view case duplication warnings, review matched duplicate cases with detailed scoring, and override duplication results when appropriate with documented justification,
> **so that** I can proceed with legitimate duplicate claims while maintaining audit trails and preventing false duplicate rejections that could delay valid claim processing.


**Key Capabilities:**

> 1. System automatically performs case duplication validation during case processing based on configured business rules (BR>Duplicate Case/Claim Validation).
> 2. When potential duplicates are identified that meet or exceed the duplication threshold score, the system displays a Warning Alert on the case overview page notifying the user that the case is possibly duplicated with other claim cases.
> 3. User accesses detailed duplication information by clicking the 'View Duplication Details' hyperlink on the warning alert, which opens a Duplication Details Drawer.
> 4. User reviews all matched cases presented in the drawer, which displays for each match:
>    4.1 Subject of claim name (hyperlinked to customer portfolio for detailed customer review)
>    4.2 Member ID for identification
>    4.3 Score components showing only non-zero values for focused review
> 5. User examines individual duplicate cases through expandable/collapsible Duplicate Case Cards (defaulting to collapsed state), which provide:
>    5.1 Case number with 'View Case' hyperlink that opens the potentially duplicate case in a new browser window for side-by-side comparison
>    5.2 Total score comparison against the configured threshold
>    5.3 Score breakdown table with matching criteria messages and individual component scores
> 6. User scrolls through duplication details when content exceeds screen length to review all matched cases.
> 7. **Alternate Flow - Override Duplication Result (Authorized Users Only)**:
>    7.1 If user possesses PRIV>CAP>Override Case Duplication Result privilege and determines the duplication warning is incorrect, user clicks 'Override Duplication Result' button in the Duplication Details Drawer
>    7.2 Override Confirmation Popup appears requiring mandatory override reason input and displaying warning that the duplicate alert will be permanently hidden after override
>    7.3 User enters override justification reason and confirms the override action
>    7.4 System processes the override, closes the popup and drawer, refreshes the page, displays success notification, and permanently removes the warning alert from the case overview
> 8. User acknowledges duplication information and proceeds with appropriate case processing based on review findings.


**Acceptance Criteria:**

> 1. **Given** the system performs case duplication validation during case processing, **when** potential duplicate cases are identified with scores meeting or exceeding the configured threshold, **then** a Warning Alert is displayed on the case overview page with the message 'This case is possibly duplicated with other claim cases, please review the duplication details' and a 'View Duplication Details' hyperlink.
> 2. **Given** a duplication warning alert is displayed on the case overview page, **when** the user clicks the 'View Duplication Details' hyperlink, **then** the Duplication Details Drawer opens and displays all matched cases with subject of claim name (hyperlinked), Member ID, and only non-zero score components.
> 3. **Given** the Duplication Details Drawer is open with multiple matched cases, **when** the drawer content exceeds screen length, **then** the content becomes scrollable to allow viewing of all matched cases.
> 4. **Given** duplicate cases are displayed in the Duplication Details Drawer, **when** the drawer initially loads, **then** all Duplicate Case Cards are displayed in collapsed state by default.
> 5. **Given** a Duplicate Case Card is displayed, **when** the user expands the card, **then** the system displays the case number with 'View Case' hyperlink, total score vs threshold comparison, and score breakdown table with matching criteria messages and individual scores.
> 6. **Given** a Duplicate Case Card displays a case number, **when** the user clicks the 'View Case' hyperlink, **then** the potentially duplicate case opens in a new browser window for side-by-side comparison.
> 7. **Given** the Duplication Details Drawer displays subject of claim names, **when** the user clicks a subject of claim name hyperlink, **then** the system navigates to the corresponding customer portfolio page.
> 8. **Given** the user has PRIV>CAP>Override Case Duplication Result privilege, **when** the Duplication Details Drawer is open, **then** the 'Override Duplication Result' button is visible and enabled.
> 9. **Given** the user does NOT have PRIV>CAP>Override Case Duplication Result privilege, **when** the Duplication Details Drawer is open, **then** the 'Override Duplication Result' button is NOT visible or accessible.
> 10. **Given** an authorized user clicks 'Override Duplication Result' button, **when** the Override Confirmation Popup appears, **then** the system displays a mandatory override reason input field and warning message indicating the duplicate alert will be permanently hidden after override.
> 11. **Given** the Override Confirmation Popup is displayed, **when** the user attempts to confirm without entering an override reason, **then** the system prevents submission and displays a validation error requiring reason input.
> 12. **Given** the user enters a valid override reason and confirms, **when** the system processes the override successfully, **then** the popup closes, drawer closes, page refreshes, success notification displays, and the warning alert is permanently removed from the case overview.
> 13. **Given** a duplication warning has been overridden, **when** the user returns to the case overview page, **then** the duplication warning alert is no longer visible and cannot be restored.
> 14. **Given** duplication validation is based on configurable business rules, **when** cases are evaluated, **then** the system applies the current BR>Duplicate Case/Claim Validation rules and threshold scores to determine duplication status.
> 15. **Given** the override action is permanent and includes user justification, **when** an override is recorded, **then** the system maintains an audit trail capturing the user identity, timestamp, override reason, and original duplication score for compliance and review purposes.

> 1. System presents an 'Additional Information' section with an 'Accident' subsection when 'Accident' is selected as the loss type during event intake.
> 2. Adjuster captures core accident temporal information including the date of accident and date of first treatment, with system enforcing logical date sequencing.
> 3. Adjuster selects the accident location from a standardized lookup list, with the ability to provide free-text description for non-standard locations.
>    3.1 When 'Other' is selected as the accident location, system displays an additional field for the adjuster to provide a descriptive explanation of the location.
> 4. Adjuster indicates whether the accident is work-related through a binary selection to support workers' compensation determination.
> 5. Adjuster identifies all loss items involved in the accident through multi-selection capability.
> 6. For child claimants, adjuster captures whether the accident occurred during organized sporting events to support coverage determination.
>    6.1 When the claim subject is identified as a child, system displays and requires input for organized sport participation status.
> 7. System validates all captured accident information against business rules and stores data in the Event Case Domain Model.
> 8. All accident information is persisted with the event case and available for downstream claim processing workflows.


**Acceptance Criteria:**

> 1. **Given** the adjuster has selected 'Accident' as the loss type during event intake, **When** the case detail step is displayed, **Then** the system presents an 'Additional Information' section with an expandable 'Accident' subsection containing all required fields.
> 2. **Given** the adjuster is entering accident date information, **When** the Date of Accident is entered, **Then** the system validates that the date is consistent with the overall Event Date and displays an error if validation fails.
> 3. **Given** the adjuster has entered a Date of Accident, **When** the Date of First Treatment is entered, **Then** the system validates that the treatment date is equal to or later than the accident date and prevents progression if earlier.
> 4. **Given** the adjuster is selecting an accident location, **When** 'Other' is selected from the Accident Location dropdown, **Then** the system displays a mandatory text input field 'Description of Accident Location' that must be completed before submission.
> 5. **Given** the claim subject has been identified as a child, **When** the accident information section is displayed, **Then** the system presents a mandatory 'Child Organized Sport' radio button field (Yes/No) that must be answered.
> 6. **Given** the claim subject is not a child, **When** the accident information section is displayed, **Then** the 'Child Organized Sport' field is not visible or required.
> 7. **Given** the adjuster is completing the accident information section, **When** the Work Related field is not answered, **Then** the system prevents case progression and displays an inline validation message indicating this mandatory field is required.
> 8. **Given** the adjuster has entered all required accident information, **When** the case intake is submitted, **Then** all accident details are persisted to the CapAccidentDetailEntity within the Event Case Domain Model.
> 9. **Given** date fields are displayed, **When** the system locale is set to en_GB, **Then** date pickers display and accept dates in DD/MM/YYYY format according to locale-specific configuration.
> 10. **Given** the adjuster has not completed all mandatory accident fields, **When** attempting to proceed to the next step or complete intake, **Then** the system blocks progression and displays inline error messages next to each incomplete required field.
> 11. **Given** multiple loss items are applicable to the accident, **When** the adjuster uses the Loss Item field, **Then** the system allows selection of multiple items from the LossItems lookup dropdown.
> 12. **Given** the accident information section is initially displayed, **When** the adjuster clicks the fold/unfold button, **Then** the section collapses or expands to show or hide detailed accident fields while maintaining entered data.

#### Feature: As a Claims Adjuster, I want to manage multiple absence reasons for a single absence case with product-specific details (Pregnancy, Bonding, Care for Family Member, Military, Own Medical Condition, Other), so that complex absence scenarios with multiple concurrent reasons are properly documented.
- **Role**: Claims Adjuster
- **Action**: add, edit, view, and remove multiple absence reasons (Pregnancy, Bonding, Care for Family Member, Military, Own Medical Condition, Other) for a single absence case during absence intake
- **Value**: complex absence scenarios with multiple concurrent reasons are properly documented and tracked

**Description:**

> **As a** Claims Adjuster,
> **I want to** add, edit, view, and remove multiple absence reasons (Pregnancy, Bonding, Care for Family Member, Military, Own Medical Condition, Other) for a single absence case during absence intake,
> **so that** complex absence scenarios with multiple concurrent reasons are properly documented and tracked.


**Key Capabilities:**

> 1. User views the Absence Reasons Section displaying all currently added absence reasons with their sequential numbers and names for the absence case.
> 2. User adds a new absence reason by selecting from available unassigned reason types (Pregnancy, Bonding, Care for Family Member, Military, Own Medical Condition, Other) through a slide-out form.
> 3. User saves the new absence reason, which is validated for uniqueness, persisted to the case, and displayed in the updated Absence Reasons Section.
> 4. User expands or collapses individual absence reason details to view or hide product-specific information associated with each reason.
> 5. User edits existing absence reasons by modifying product-specific details while the reason type remains fixed.
> 6. User removes absence reasons from the case when multiple reasons exist, with automatic renumbering of remaining reasons.
>    6.1. If only one absence reason exists, removal is disabled to enforce minimum requirement.
> 7. User navigates away from unsaved forms with confirmation to prevent accidental data loss.
>    7.1. If user attempts to close the Add/Edit form with unsaved changes, system prompts for confirmation before discarding changes.
> 8. User manages 'Other' reason type as a special category that can be added multiple times when different secondary reasons exist.
>    8.1. For 'Other' reason type, the expandable details view is hidden and the reason remains available in the dropdown until all secondary reasons are assigned.


**Acceptance Criteria:**

> **Positive Scenarios:**
> 1. Given an absence case is open during intake, When the user views the Absence Reasons Section, Then the system displays all added absence reasons with sequential numbering and reason names mapped to CapAbsenceReasonEntity.absenceReasons.
> 2. Given the user clicks the 'Add' button in the Absence Reasons Section, When the Add Absence Reason pop-up opens, Then the dropdown displays only absence reason types that have not been assigned to the current case (except 'Other' which may appear multiple times).
> 3. Given the user selects a valid absence reason and clicks 'Save', When the system validates uniqueness, Then the reason is persisted, the pop-up closes, and the Absence Reasons Section updates to display the new reason.
> 4. Given multiple absence reasons exist in the case, When the user clicks the edit icon next to a reason, Then the slide-out form opens with all fields populated and the reason dropdown is disabled showing the current reason type.
> 5. Given multiple absence reasons exist in the case, When the user clicks the remove icon and confirms the removal, Then the system removes the reason, automatically renumbers remaining reasons sequentially, and updates the display.
> 6. Given the user selects 'Other' as an absence reason, When the reason is saved, Then the system allows 'Other' to be added again if different secondary reasons exist, and hides the expandable details icon for the 'Other' reason type.
> 7. Given the user clicks an expandable icon next to a reason (except 'Other'), When the icon is clicked, Then the system toggles the display of product-specific details for that absence reason.
> 8. Given the user has made changes in the Add/Edit form, When the user clicks the Close (X) icon or Cancel button, Then the system displays a confirmation modal 'Are you sure you want to close this form?' with Yes/No options, and closes without saving only if Yes is selected.
>
> **Negative Scenarios:**
> 1. Given the user attempts to add an absence reason that already exists in the case (except 'Other'), When the user selects the duplicate reason and clicks 'Save', Then the system prevents saving and displays an error message indicating the reason already exists.
> 2. Given only one absence reason exists in the case, When the user views the Absence Reasons Section, Then the remove icon is hidden for that single reason to enforce the minimum requirement of at least one reason per case.
> 3. Given the user opens the edit form for an existing reason, When the form loads, Then the reason type dropdown is disabled and cannot be changed, ensuring reason type immutability after creation.
> 4. Given the user clicks the remove icon and the confirmation modal appears, When the user selects 'No', Then the removal action is cancelled and the reason remains in the case without any changes.
> 5. Given 'Other' reason type has been added for all possible secondary reasons, When the user opens the Add Absence Reason dropdown, Then 'Other' is no longer available as an option until a secondary reason is freed.

#### Feature: As a Claims Operations Manager, I want the system to automatically initialize and validate claims based on policy integration and applicability rules during intake, so that eligible claims are created efficiently without manual intervention.
- **Role**: Claims Operations Manager
- **Action**: automatically initialize and validate dental claims through a structured four-step intake workflow with policy integration and applicability rules
- **Value**: eligible dental claims are created efficiently with complete data validation, proper draft management, and automated claim submission without manual intervention

**Description:**

> **As a** Claims Operations Manager,
> **I want to** automatically initialize and validate dental claims through a structured four-step intake workflow with policy integration and applicability rules,
> **so that** eligible dental claims are created efficiently with complete data validation, proper draft management, and automated claim submission without manual intervention.


**Key Capabilities:**

> 1. User initiates dental claim creation through a structured four-step wizard (Policy and Patient Selection → Claim Info Entry → Upload Documents → Review and Submit).
> 2. During Step 1 (Policy and Patient Selection):
>    2.1 System prevents premature claim creation by disabling action buttons until required policy and patient information is provided.
>    2.2 User searches and selects the applicable policy and patient.
>    2.3 System enables claim creation and initiates the loss event through the initLoss command.
>    2.4 System transitions the interface to support ongoing claim development by enabling draft-saving and replacing cancellation with withdrawal options.
> 3. During Step 2 (Claim Info Entry):
>    3.1 User enters detailed claim information with validation applied through UIClaimInfoValidation rules.
>    3.2 System saves draft state through updateLossDraft command when navigating forward or backward.
>    3.3 User can navigate to previous or next steps, with system maintaining visited step history.
> 4. During Step 3 (Upload Documents):
>    4.1 User uploads supporting documentation for the claim.
>    4.2 System saves draft state when navigating between steps.
> 5. During Step 4 (Review and Submit):
>    5.1 User reviews complete claim information before submission.
>    5.2 System applies comprehensive validation through ClaimUpdateValidation rules.
>    5.3 System executes ClaimSubmitAction to locate the correct policy version and create the claim.
>    5.4 System navigates to submission confirmation upon successful claim creation.
> 6. Throughout the intake process after claim initiation:
>    6.1 User can save work-in-progress and exit at any point, with system persisting data even if validation has not yet been satisfied.
>    6.2 User can withdraw the claim with confirmation, resulting in claim closure with 'Abandoned' reason.
>    6.3 User can close the claim with confirmation, resulting in claim closure with 'Canceled' reason.
>    6.4 User can navigate backward to previous steps with draft data automatically saved.
> 7. System enforces workflow progression by marking steps as visited and maintaining state across navigation events.
> 8. System integrates with policy management to automatically identify applicable policy versions and validate coverage during claim submission.


**Acceptance Criteria:**

> 1. **Given** the user opens the New Claim creation workspace for a dental claim,
>    **When** the system initializes,
>    **Then** the 'Create Claim and Continue' and 'Save & Exit' buttons are disabled until policy and patient are selected.
>
> 2. **Given** the user has selected a valid policy and patient in Step 1,
>    **When** the user clicks 'Create Claim and Continue',
>    **Then** the system calls initLoss command, marks Step 1 as visited, replaces 'Create Claim and Continue' with 'Next', replaces 'Cancel' with 'Withdraw', enables 'Save & Exit', and navigates to Step 2 Claim Info page.
>
> 3. **Given** the user is on Step 2 Claim Info page,
>    **When** the user clicks 'Next' without completing required claim information,
>    **Then** the system applies UIClaimInfoValidation rules and prevents navigation if validation fails, displaying appropriate error messages.
>
> 4. **Given** the user is on Step 2 Claim Info page with valid data entered,
>    **When** the user clicks 'Next',
>    **Then** the system calls updateLossDraft command, marks Step 2 as visited, and navigates to Step 3 Upload Documents page.
>
> 5. **Given** the user is on Step 3 Upload Documents page,
>    **When** the user clicks 'Next',
>    **Then** the system calls updateLossDraft command and navigates to Step 4 Review Claim page.
>
> 6. **Given** the user is on Step 4 Review Claim page,
>    **When** the user clicks 'Submit Claim',
>    **Then** the system validates data using ClaimUpdateValidation, executes ClaimSubmitAction, locates the correct policy version using Locate_Policy_Version business rule, creates the claim, and navigates to the submission result page.
>
> 7. **Given** the user has initiated a claim (after Step 1 completion) and is on any subsequent step,
>    **When** the user clicks 'Save & Exit' and confirms,
>    **Then** the system persists all entered data as a draft (even if validation has not passed) and exits the intake UI.
>
> 8. **Given** the user has initiated a claim and is on any step after Step 1,
>    **When** the user clicks 'Withdraw' and confirms the prompt 'Your changes will be lost. Are you sure you want to withdraw the claim and exit the form?',
>    **Then** the system closes the claim with reason 'Abandoned' and exits the intake UI.
>
> 9. **Given** the user has initiated a claim and is on any step after Step 1,
>    **When** the user clicks 'Close' and confirms the prompt 'Are you sure you want to close the claim and exit the form?',
>    **Then** the system closes the claim with reason 'Canceled' and exits the intake UI.
>
> 10. **Given** the user is on Step 2, Step 3, or Step 4,
>     **When** the user clicks 'Previous',
>     **Then** the system calls updateLossDraft command to save current state and navigates to the previous step, allowing the user to resume from that point.
>
> 11. **Given** the user navigates backward from Step 2 to Step 1,
>     **When** the system displays Step 1,
>     **Then** the 'Create Claim and Continue' button is displayed again (not 'Next'), and the user can modify policy/patient selection if needed.
>
> 12. **Given** the user completes all four steps and submits the claim,
>     **When** the system processes the submission,
>     **Then** the claim is created within the system, linked to the correct policy version, and the user is presented with a submission confirmation page.
>
> 13. **Negative Scenario - Given** the user is on Step 4 Review Claim page with incomplete or invalid data,
>     **When** the user clicks 'Submit Claim',
>     **Then** ClaimUpdateValidation fails, the system prevents submission, and displays specific validation error messages indicating the data issues.
>
> 14. **Negative Scenario - Given** the user has not yet clicked 'Create Claim and Continue' in Step 1,
>     **When** the user attempts to navigate or save,
>     **Then** the system prevents these actions as the claim has not been initialized.
>
> 15. **Given** the user saves a draft at any point after claim initiation,
>     **When** the user re-opens the draft claim,
>     **Then** all previously entered data is restored, visited steps are marked, and the user can continue from the last saved state.

### Epic: Operational Workflow & Task Management

#### Feature: As a Claims Adjuster, I want to access the Claim Intake queue, so that I can view and manage incoming claims that require processing.
- **Role**: Claims Adjuster
- **Action**: access the Claim Intake queue with proper authorization controls
- **Value**: I can view and manage incoming claims that require processing while maintaining secure, role-based access control

**Description:**

> **As a** Claims Adjuster,
> **I want to** access the Claim Intake queue with proper authorization controls,
> **so that** I can view and manage incoming claims that require processing while maintaining secure, role-based access control.


**Key Capabilities:**

> 1. Authenticated user attempts to access the Claim Intake queue within the CAP subsystem for Benefits/Dental line of business.
> 2. System validates user's assigned privileges against the 'Claim - Access Claim Intake Queue' privilege requirement.
>    2.1 **Main Flow (Authorized Access)**: When user possesses the required privilege (standard for Claim Adjuster and Claim Supervisor roles), system grants access to the Claim Intake queue and allows user to view and interact with pending claims for processing.
>    2.2 **Alternate Flow (Unauthorized Access)**: When user lacks the required privilege (e.g., Customer Service Representative role), system denies access to the Claim Intake queue and prevents viewing or interaction with claim intake operations.
> 3. Authorized users proceed to perform claim intake processing activities including viewing, assigning, and managing incoming claims within the queue.


**Acceptance Criteria:**

> 1. **Given** a user with Claim Adjuster role is authenticated in CAP subsystem, **When** the user attempts to access the Claim Intake queue, **Then** the system grants access and displays the queue with all pending claims for the Benefits/Dental line of business.
> 2. **Given** a user with Claim Supervisor role is authenticated in CAP subsystem, **When** the user attempts to access the Claim Intake queue, **Then** the system grants access and allows full interaction with queue management functions.
> 3. **Given** a user with Customer Service Representative role is authenticated in CAP subsystem, **When** the user attempts to access the Claim Intake queue, **Then** the system denies access and does not display the Claim Intake queue interface.
> 4. **Given** an authenticated user without 'Claim - Access Claim Intake Queue' privilege, **When** the user attempts any direct navigation to Claim Intake queue, **Then** the system blocks access and prevents viewing of any claim intake data.
> 5. **Given** a user's role is modified to remove the 'Claim - Access Claim Intake Queue' privilege, **When** the user's next session begins, **Then** the system enforces the updated permissions and denies Claim Intake queue access.
> 6. **Given** a Claims Adjuster has accessed the Claim Intake queue, **When** viewing the queue, **Then** the user can perform standard claim intake operations (view, assign, process) according to their role permissions.
> 7. **Given** privilege assignment is based on user role configuration, **When** system evaluates access control, **Then** the decision is made in real-time based on current privilege assignments without requiring system restart.

> 12. System validates the case for open status, with user potentially needing to edit case information if validation fails.
> 13. System supports continuation of incomplete intake sessions when individuals who started portal intake contact Call Center for assistance, allowing Call Center staff to continue from where the user left off.
> 14. All intake processes use the unified Smart Form UI technology regardless of entry channel to ensure consistency and reduce maintenance overhead.


**Acceptance Criteria:**

> 1. **Given** a user initiates intake via CSSR Customer Portfolio or CAP Home page, **when** the system is accessed, **then** the Persona Core common module is called and the unified smart form interface loads within 3 seconds.
> 2. **Given** a user is entering subject of claim information, **when** the data is submitted, **then** the system validates the data and displays specific error messages for any validation failures within 2 seconds.
> 3. **Given** subject of claim validation passes, **when** the validation completes, **then** the system automatically creates an Event Case and assigns a unique case identifier.
> 4. **Given** a user is inputting case details, **when** validation fails, **then** the system displays inline error messages and prevents progression to the next step until corrections are made.
> 5. **Given** a user is inputting additional information, **when** validation fails, **then** the system displays inline error messages and prevents progression to document upload until corrections are made.
> 6. **Given** a user uploads documents, **when** documents are submitted, **then** the system accepts common file formats (PDF, JPG, PNG, DOCX) up to specified size limits and associates them with the Event Case.
> 7. **Given** a user reviews and submits all intake data, **when** final validation is performed, **then** the system validates all sections comprehensively and either accepts submission or returns user to specific failed sections with clear error indicators.
> 8. **Given** final validation fails, **when** the user is returned to edit, **then** the user can modify any section (subject of claim, case details, additional information, or documents) and all previously entered valid data is preserved.

> 11. **Given** at least one applicable claim exists, **when** evaluation completes, **then** the system automatically creates all identified applicable claims with unique claim identifiers.
> 12. **Given** claims are created, **when** eligibility and benefit calculation runs, **then** the system completes calculations within 10 seconds and stores results against each claim.
> 13. **Given** eligibility and benefits are calculated, **when** automatic payment check runs, **then** the system determines payment eligibility and either creates a payment template (if automatic payment possible) or flags for manual payment processing.
> 14. **Given** automatic payment is possible, **when** the payment template is created, **then** the system validates the case for open status and either opens the case or presents validation errors.
> 15. **Given** validation for open status fails, **when** the error is presented, **then** the user can edit necessary case information to resolve validation issues.
> 16. **Given** a Call Center staff member is assisting intake, **when** they use the unified interface, **then** the same validation rules, workflows, and data collection processes apply as for self-service portal intake.
> 17. **Given** an individual started intake via portal but encountered problems, **when** they contact Call Center, **then** Call Center staff can access and continue the incomplete intake session from where the individual left off.
> 18. **Given** customer data requires confirmation during intake, **when** the data is presented, **then** the user can update address, payment method, and work details within the intake flow.
> 19. **Given** an intake must be processed for a non-customer claimant, **when** the intake is initiated, **then** the system allows intake creation and processes it according to legal obligations without requiring existing customer status.
> 20. **Given** an intake is split into multiple claims, **when** claims are created, **then** the system maintains linkage between all claims and the originating Event Case for tracking and reporting purposes.

- **Value**: I can quickly locate relevant claims regardless of product line or LOB, reducing search time and improving operational efficiency

**Description:**

> **As a** Claims Adjuster,
> **I want to** search and filter cases and claims across all domains (Benefits, P&C, Dental) using a unified search interface with single-line quick search and advanced multi-criteria search capabilities,
> **so that** I can quickly locate relevant claims regardless of product line or LOB, reducing search time and improving operational efficiency.


**Key Capabilities:**

> 1. User activates unified search interface to locate cases and claims across all domains (Benefits, P&C, Dental).
> 2. User performs Single-Line Quick Search by clicking the search icon, entering free-text into the search bar, and receiving auto-suggestions.
>    2.1 System queries multiple fields simultaneously based on free-text input and displays top 5 matching results as auto-suggestions.
>    2.2 Auto-suggestions display entity identifiers and subject/name based on claim type: Benefits claims show Case Number and Claim Number with Subject of Claim; P&C claims show Claim Number with Subject of Claim; Dental claims show Claim Number with Patient name.
>    2.3 User selects a result from auto-suggestions to navigate directly to the appropriate destination based on entity type and status.
>    2.4 User clicks 'View All' link to see full search results table in the Case/Claim Search Result and Case/Claim List view.
>    2.5 User clears search input by clicking the clear (X) button, which removes text and auto-suggestions.

>    3.2 User selects one or multiple claim types from the Claim Type/LOB multi-select dropdown (CI, HI, Life, Accident, STD, LTD, SMP, Leave, Dental, Permanent Life, Auto, Home).
>    3.3 For P&C Home claims, system uses covered property address for State, ZIP Code, and City fields instead of party address.
>    3.4 User clicks Search button to submit the search request.
>    3.5 System closes the advanced search panel and displays results in the Case/Claim Search Result and Case/Claim List view.
>    3.6 User clears all advanced search criteria by clicking the Clear button.
> 4. User switches between entity types (Customers, Quotes/Policies, Compensations, Case/Claims) using the Entity Selector Button to change search context.
> 5. System redirects user to appropriate destination based on entity type and status:
>    5.1 For Benefits Claims with both case and claim existing, system redirects to Claim Overview page.
>    5.2 For Benefits Claims with case only and incomplete intake, system redirects to Member Form.
>    5.3 For Benefits Claims with case only and complete intake, system redirects to Event Case Overview.
>    5.4 For Dental Claims with Incomplete status, system redirects to Dental Claim Intake.
>    5.5 For Dental Claims with Pending/Open/Suspended/Closed status, system redirects to Dental Claim Overview.


**Acceptance Criteria:**

> 1. **Given** the user clicks the search icon, **When** the action is executed, **Then** the search bar is activated with cursor positioned in the input field.

**Description:**

> **As a** Claims Adjuster,
> **I want to** navigate through a multi-step claim intake workflow with clear progress indicators and step-by-step guidance to collect all required information,
> **so that** I can efficiently and accurately capture complete claim information before submission, reducing errors and ensuring compliance with data requirements.


**Key Capabilities:**

> 1. User receives initial guidance and warning that the claim submission process must be completed in one continuous session without interruption.
> 2. User provides employee and employment information including name, class, employer, work state, occupation, hire date, and selects payment method with mailing address confirmation.
> 3. User classifies the claim by selecting event type, providing event description, entering accident details (cause, dates, location), and indicating applicable loss types.
>   3.1 System enforces selection of at least one loss type from: death, terminal illness, serious illness, hospital services, or work absence before allowing progression.
> 4. User uploads supporting documentation through file interface, with system accepting multiple formats (.zip, .doc, .docx, .pdf, .png, .jpg) and providing guidance on required documentation elements (provider details, billing information, service dates).
> 5. User reviews comprehensive summary of all entered information across all steps for verification and accuracy before final submission.
> 6. User accepts terms and conditions, acknowledges fraud warning, and submits the claim to trigger backend processing.
>   6.1 System maps portal data to Event Case and Claim Event entities.
>   6.2 System sets reporting method as 'SelfServicePortal' and reported date as current date.
>   6.3 System uploads documents to case e-folder and updates Event Case via API.
>   6.4 System retrieves and assigns claim numbers automatically.
> 7. User receives confirmation page with success indicator and option to navigate to Case Overview page.

#### Feature: As a Claims Adjuster, I want to create and manage claims of different types (STD, LTD, SMP, TL, CI, Dental, P&C) from a unified case overview interface, so that I can handle multi-LOB cases without switching between different systems
- **Role**: Claims Adjuster
- **Action**: create and manage claims of different types (STD, LTD, SMP, TL, CI, Dental, P&C) from a unified case overview interface
- **Value**: I can handle multi-LOB cases without switching between different systems

**Description:**

> **As a** Claims Adjuster,
> **I want to** create and manage claims of different types (STD, LTD, SMP, TL, CI, Dental, P&C) from a unified case overview interface,
> **so that** I can handle multi-LOB cases without switching between different systems.


**Key Capabilities:**

> 1. Claims Adjuster accesses the unified Event Case Overview interface to view all claims associated with an event across different lines of business (STD, LTD, SMP, TL, CI, Dental, P&C).
> 2. When the policy is already known in the system, the adjuster initiates creation of a new STD claim directly from the Event Case interface.
>    2.1 System provides specialized STD claim creation workflow with appropriate fields and validation specific to short-term disability products.
> 3. Adjuster completes required information for the STD claim and submits for creation.
>    3.1 System creates the STD claim and associates it with the parent Event Case.
> 4. Once STD claim is created, adjuster can edit and update the claim information through the same Event Case Overview interface.
> 5. Adjuster navigates between different claim types (STD, LTD, SMP, TL, CI, Dental, P&C) within the unified interface without leaving the Event Case context.
> 6. System maintains consistent user experience and navigation patterns across all claim types while supporting product-specific business rules and data requirements.
> 7. All claims related to the Event Case remain accessible and manageable from the single Event Case Overview workspace.


**Acceptance Criteria:**

> 1. **Given** a Claims Adjuster is viewing an Event Case Overview, **when** the interface loads, **then** all associated claims across different LOBs (STD, LTD, SMP, TL, CI, Dental, P&C) are displayed in a unified view.
> 2. **Given** a policy is already known in the system, **when** the adjuster initiates STD claim creation from Event Case interface, **then** the STD-specific claim creation workflow is presented with appropriate fields and validations.
> 3. **Given** the adjuster is creating a new STD claim, **when** required information is completed and submitted, **then** the system creates the STD claim and links it to the parent Event Case within 5 seconds.
> 4. **Given** an STD claim has been created, **when** the adjuster accesses the Event Case Overview, **then** the STD claim is visible and editable through the same interface.
> 5. **Given** multiple claim types exist within an Event Case, **when** the adjuster navigates between different claim types, **then** the system maintains context and does not require re-authentication or system switching.
> 6. **Given** the adjuster attempts to create an STD claim, **when** the policy is not known in the system, **then** the system blocks claim creation and displays an error message indicating policy must be established first.
> 7. **Given** the adjuster is editing an existing STD claim, **when** changes are saved, **then** the updated information is persisted and reflected in the Event Case Overview immediately.
> 8. **Given** the Event Case contains claims from multiple LOBs, **when** the adjuster views the case, **then** each claim type displays with its product-specific attributes while maintaining consistent navigation and layout patterns.
> 9. **Given** the adjuster is working within the unified Event Case interface, **when** switching between claim management tasks across different LOBs, **then** all actions (create, edit, view) are accessible without leaving the Event Case workspace.

#### Feature: As a Claims Adjuster, I want to enter and validate UK postal codes using UK-specific validation rules, so that address data is compliant with UK postal code standards.
- **Role**: Claims Adjuster
- **Action**: enter and validate UK postal codes using UK-specific validation rules across all address entry points in the claims management system when the system locale is set to en_GB
- **Value**: address data is compliant with UK postal code standards and ensures data integrity for UK-based Income Protection (GIP) claims processing

**Description:**

> **As a** Claims Adjuster,
> **I want to** enter and validate UK postal codes using UK-specific validation rules across all address entry points in the claims management system when the system locale is set to en_GB,
> **so that** address data is compliant with UK postal code standards and ensures data integrity for UK-based Income Protection (GIP) claims processing.


**Key Capabilities:**

> 1. System detects locale setting as 'en_GB' and activates UK-specific validation rules for all postal code fields throughout the claims management application.
> 2. During event case intake when adding a new member, user enters address information with UK postal code validation applied to the Zip Code/Postal Code field (mandatory field, disabled after initial entry).
> 3. When editing existing member work details during event case intake, user enters postal code in the Zip Code field which applies UK postcode validation (mandatory but disabled field).
> 4. When managing party information (adding, editing, or searching parties - both individual and organization), user enters address details where the Zip Code field applies UK-specific postcode validation rules.
> 5. When configuring payment methods with cheque delivery addresses, user enters address information where postal code field applies UK postcode validation and formatting.
> 6. When managing deductions, user enters address information for deduction-related parties where postal code applies UK validation rules.
> 7. System enforces UK postcode validation format which includes:
>    7.1 Proper UK postcode structure and pattern validation
>    7.2 Mandatory field requirement for all UK address entries
>    7.3 Integration with UK county (relabeled from State/Province) lookup values
> 8. All postal code fields display with label 'Zip Code/Postal Code' to accommodate multi-market terminology while applying locale-specific validation.
> 9. System maintains country default as 'United Kingdom' (mandatory, disabled in most contexts) to ensure postal code validation context is consistent.
> 10. UK postal code validation is consistently applied across all functional areas including: Event Case Intake, Party Management, Payment Methods, Recoveries, Deductions, and Case Overview displays.
> 11. System maintains audit trail and history records that preserve UK postal code formatting and validation context.


**Acceptance Criteria:**

> 1. **Given** the system locale is set to 'en_GB',
>    **When** a Claims Adjuster enters a postal code in any address field,
>    **Then** the system applies UK-specific postal code validation rules and rejects invalid UK postcode formats.
>
> 2. **Given** a Claims Adjuster is adding a new member during event case intake,
>    **When** the Zip Code/Postal Code field (section 4.7) is populated,
>    **Then** the field is mandatory, applies UK postcode validation, and becomes disabled after successful validation.
>
> 3. **Given** a Claims Adjuster is editing member work details,
>    **When** entering the Zip Code field,
>    **Then** UK postcode validation is enforced, the field is mandatory but disabled, and County field uses UK county lookup values.
>
> 4. **Given** a Claims Adjuster is adding or editing individual party information,
>    **When** entering address details,
>    **Then** Country defaults to 'United Kingdom', County is relabeled and uses UK lookup values, and Zip Code applies UK postcode validation.
>
> 5. **Given** a Claims Adjuster is adding or editing organization party information,
>    **When** entering address details,
>    **Then** the same UK postcode validation rules apply as for individual parties.
>
> 6. **Given** a Claims Adjuster is configuring a payment method with cheque delivery,
>    **When** entering the Cheque Address,
>    **Then** postal code field applies UK postcode validation with UK formatting for county and country defaulting to 'United Kingdom'.
>
> 7. **Given** locale is set to 'en_GB',
>    **When** a postal code field is displayed anywhere in the system,
>    **Then** the label reads 'Zip Code/Postal Code' to accommodate multi-market terminology.
>
> 8. **Given** a Claims Adjuster enters an invalid UK postal code format,
>    **When** attempting to save or proceed,
>    **Then** the system blocks submission and displays an inline validation error message next to the postal code field.
>
> 9. **Given** a Claims Adjuster is managing deductions,
>    **When** entering address information,
>    **Then** County field is relabeled and uses UK lookup values, and postal code applies UK-specific validation.
>
> 10. **Given** postal code data has been successfully entered and validated,
>     **When** viewing Case Overview header or any display screen,
>     **Then** the postal code displays in UK-specific formatting consistent with UK standards.
>
> 11. **Given** the system locale is NOT set to 'en_GB',
>     **When** a user enters postal code information,
>     **Then** UK-specific postal code validation is NOT applied and standard zip code validation is used instead.
>
> 12. **Given** a Claims Adjuster has entered a valid UK postal code,
>     **When** the record is saved and retrieved,
>     **Then** the postal code is preserved with correct UK formatting and validation context in all history and audit trails.
>
> 13. **Given** the Country field is set to 'United Kingdom',
>     **When** postal code validation is triggered,
>     **Then** the system enforces UK postcode validation rules consistently across all claims management functional areas including Event Case Intake, Party Management, Payment Methods, Recoveries, and Deductions.

### Epic: Product-Specific Domain Logic & Configuration

#### Feature: As a Claims Adjuster, I want to configure and track multiple accumulator types (Per Lifetime, Per Event, Per Benefit Year, Per Calendar Year) for each coverage, so that benefit limits are accurately enforced across claims.
- **Role**: Claim Adjuster
- **Action**: configure and enforce multiple accumulator types across various time periods, coverage scopes, and measurement units to ensure accurate benefit limit tracking
- **Value**: benefit payments remain within contractual policy limits, preventing overpayments and ensuring regulatory compliance across diverse product lines

**Description:**

> As a **Claim Adjuster**,
> I want to **configure and enforce multiple accumulator types across various time periods, coverage scopes, and measurement units to ensure accurate benefit limit tracking**,
> So that **benefit payments remain within contractual policy limits, preventing overpayments and ensuring regulatory compliance across diverse product lines**.


**Key Capabilities:**

> 1. Configure accumulator types by defining scope (individual/group-level), time dimension (lifetime/benefit year/calendar year/per event/per confinement), measurement unit (money/days/visits), and applicable product lines
> 2. Upon coverage activation, system initiates accumulator tracking by establishing baseline criteria and matching parameters
> 3. Calculate current accumulation by summing indemnity payments with specified status (Issued/Cleared) filtered by policy ID, insured, coverage/group, date range, and event identifiers
> 4. Compare accumulated totals against configured limits; system prevents additional payments when thresholds are reached
> 5. When dual accumulator types apply, enforce both limits simultaneously
> 6. Reset accumulators automatically based on time dimension rules


**Acceptance Criteria:**

> 1. **Given** a coverage with lifetime group-level limits, **when** indemnity payments reach the configured maximum, **then** system blocks further payments across all coverages in that group
> 2. **Given** benefit year-based accumulators, **when** policy anniversary occurs, **then** system resets accumulation counters and permits new benefit usage
> 3. **Given** dual accumulator constraints, **when** either limit is exceeded, **then** system prevents payment authorization
> 4. **Given** payment status changes to Cleared, **when** accumulator recalculation occurs, **then** system updates totals reflecting only eligible payment statuses
> 5. **Given** per-event accumulators, **when** a new claim event is created, **then** system establishes independent accumulator tracking
> 6. **Given** incomplete matching criteria, **when** payment submission is attempted, **then** system prevents processing until all required identifiers are provided

**Description:**

> As a **Claim Adjuster**,
> I want to **automatically calculate and reserve accumulator amounts when a settlement is approved**,
> So that **remaining benefit limits are accurately updated for future claims without manual intervention**.


**Key Capabilities:**

> 1. System calculates remaining amounts using minimum of single accumulator, prorated days multiplied by benefit amount, and group accumulator limits
> 2. Upon year-end crossing (Calendar or Benefit Year), system divides date ranges into separate periods and applies accumulator rules independently
>     2.1 Calendar Year boundaries apply January 1 through December 31
>     2.2 Benefit Year boundaries apply from policy effective date through twelve months forward
> 3. When accumulator units differ, system converts unit amounts to monetary values using benefit amount multipliers and additional percentages
> 4. System calculates settlement remaining amount by evaluating all coverages sharing the same settlement number
> 5. Upon settlement approval, system reserves calculated amounts against applicable single and group accumulators
> 6. If coverage modifications occur, system recalculates using settlement used amounts and adjusts reserves, generating overpayment records when necessary


**Acceptance Criteria:**

> 1. **Given** a settlement approval with date range within single year, **When** system calculates reserves, **Then** remaining amount equals minimum of single accumulator, days times benefit amount, and group accumulator
> 2. **Given** a settlement spanning Calendar or Benefit Year boundary, **When** system processes approval, **Then** date range splits into two periods with separate accumulator calculations applied
> 3. **Given** accumulator units differ between single and group, **When** calculation executes, **Then** system converts unit amounts to money using benefit amount multipliers before comparison
> 4. **Given** multiple coverages under one settlement, **When** remaining amount calculates, **Then** system considers total used amounts across all associated coverages
> 5. **Given** coverage amount modification post-approval, **When** recalculation triggers, **Then** system adjusts reserves and generates overpayment if new amount is less than issued
> 6. **Given** dynamic group limit applies, **When** coverage cancellation occurs, **Then** system recalculates group limit and withholds amounts from remaining coverages to offset discrepancies

**Description:**

> As a **Claim Adjuster**,
> I want to **ensure diagnosis information is automatically populated from source records and validated against integrity rules during claim initiation and submission**,
> So that **claim diagnosis data maintains integrity, uniqueness, compliance with clinical coding standards, and prevents downstream adjudication errors**.


**Key Capabilities:**

> 1. Upon claim initiation for STD/SMD/LTD, system automatically populates diagnosis codes and accident-versus-sickness designation from applicable source record (Event Case or predecessor STD Claim based on timing and existence rules)
>     1.1 When LTD claim is created simultaneously with or before STD claim, system defaults diagnosis from Event Case
>     1.2 When LTD claim is created after STD claim exists, system defaults diagnosis from STD claim instead
> 2. System enforces one-time data copy principle, preventing bidirectional synchronization between source and target records post-initiation
> 3. User is able to modify pre-populated diagnosis information during manual claim intake via designated menu
> 4. Upon claim submission, system validates diagnosis code uniqueness across all entries for the claim
> 5. System validates exactly one diagnosis code is designated as primary before allowing submission
> 6. System prevents submission when diagnosis date is recorded as future date


**Acceptance Criteria:**

> 1. **Given** STD or SMD claim is initiated automatically from event case, **When** claim record is created, **Then** diagnosis codes and accident/sickness indicator are pre-populated from event case without user intervention
> 2. **Given** LTD claim is initiated and no STD claim exists, **When** claim creation occurs, **Then** diagnosis information defaults from event case ICD codes
> 3. **Given** LTD claim is created after existing STD claim, **When** system determines defaulting source, **Then** diagnosis information is populated from STD claim instead of event case
> 4. **Given** user attempts submission with duplicate ICD codes, **When** validation executes, **Then** system prevents submission and indicates duplication error

**Acceptance Criteria:**

> 1. **Given** a payment level has existing payment schedules with states 'Active', 'Suspended', or 'Open',
>    **When** a new payment schedule is created for the same payment level,
>    **Then** all existing schedules are automatically deactivated according to the Payment Schedule Life Cycle commands.
>
> 2. **Given** a payment level has existing payments in 'Approved' state,
>    **When** a new payment schedule is created for the same payment level,
>    **Then** all approved payments are automatically canceled with message code 'BuildPaymentScheduleFlow-CancelActivePayments', severity 'info', and message text 'Payment is automatically canceled during the Build Payment Schedule Flow process.'
>
> 3. **Given** financial data is available for payment calculation,
>    **When** the Payment Scheduling Service executes,
>    **Then** the system generates a complete list of calculated payments including both issued and future payments.
>
> 4. **Given** errors occur during Payment Scheduling Service execution,
>    **When** the service fails,
>    **Then** the system creates a task titled 'Payment Scheduling process failed' and terminates the process without creating a payment schedule.
>
> 5. **Given** a payment schedule has been initialized,
>    **When** the activation command is executed,
>    **Then** the system successfully transitions the schedule to 'Active' state or creates a 'Review Payment Schedule' task if activation fails.

>   6.5 Prevent Payment Frequency updates during claim adjustment process.
> 7. Return complete payment schedule with all processed payments, allocations, adjustments, and validation status for downstream processing.


**Acceptance Criteria:**

> 1. **Given** a payment template is submitted for validation, **when** all required fields are present and conform to business rules, **then** the system returns validationStatus 'Valid' with no error messages and proceeds to payment generation.
> 2. **Given** a payment template with missing or invalid data, **when** validation is performed, **then** the system returns validationStatus 'Invalid' with error messages containing severity, code, and message details, and terminates processing without generating payments.
> 3. **Given** an Actual Services claim with approved settlement, **when** payment allocations are generated, **then** grossAmount is set from paymentAmount of Allowed settlement and paymentDate is set to Payment Schedule's Creation Date.
> 4. **Given** an Orthodontic Services claim with Monthly frequency and orthoMonthQuantity of 12, **when** payment allocations are generated, **then** the system creates 12 monthly payments with amounts calculated as PaymentAmount/12 rounded to 2 decimal places, with last payment adjusted to reconcile total.
> 5. **Given** an Orthodontic Services claim with Quarterly frequency, **when** payment allocations are generated, **then** the system calculates payment amount as (PaymentAmount/orthoMonthQuantity)*3 and generates payments every 3 calendar months until orthoMonthQuantity is reached.
> 6. **Given** an Orthodontic Services claim with One-Time frequency, **when** payment allocations are generated, **then** the system creates a single payment with full PaymentAmount and current date.
> 7. **Given** a payment date falls on a day not present in the target month, **when** calculating next payment date, **then** the system maps to the last day of the target month.
> 8. **Given** multiple payment allocations exist, **when** generating payment schedule, **then** the system groups allocations by paymentDate plus payee and assigns unique paymentId to each PaymentPayableItem.
> 9. **Given** payment allocations are grouped, **when** calculating paymentNetAmount, **then** the system sums all allocationNetAmount values, or sets to 0 if paymentAllocations is null.
> 10. **Given** Claim Intake Fees are added to a claim, **when** applying adjustments, **then** the system adds fees to paymentNetAmount of first upcoming payment (earliest future post date excluding Issued/Stop Requested).
> 11. **Given** a Reduction Amount exceeds first payment amount, **when** applying reduction, **then** the system applies maximum reduction to first payment and cascades remaining reduction to subsequent payments until full amount is applied.
> 12. **Given** a payment with applied adjustments fails with Decline or Void status, **when** user accesses payment actions, **then** the system hides 'Adjust Payment(s)' action and prevents recalculation of applied adjustments in new schedules.
> 13. **Given** a payment reaches Issued or Stop Requested status, **when** user accesses payment actions, **then** the system hides 'Adjust Payment(s)' action to prevent further modifications.
> 14. **Given** an orthodontic claim requires rescheduling, **when** reschedule process is initiated, **then** the system unreserves limits, recalculates New Payable Amount, cancels Pending Post/Approved payments, keeps issued payments unchanged, and regenerates new payment series starting from current date.
> 15. **Given** an orthodontic claim is being adjusted, **when** user attempts to change Payment Frequency, **then** the system prevents the frequency update and maintains original frequency setting.
> 16. **Given** newly added Fees are applied to a payment that subsequently fails (Decline or Void), **when** user attempts to edit or delete fees, **then** the system prevents modification and excludes failed fees from recalculation in new payment schedules.
> 17. **Given** all payment allocations and adjustments are processed, **when** returning payment schedule, **then** the system outputs complete structure including Root Entity with direction 'outgoing', Payment Details, Payment Allocations, Loss Info, Payable Items, and Dental Details with all amounts rounded to 2 decimal places.

#### Feature: As a Claims Operations Manager, I want the system to automatically complete a payment schedule when all payments have been generated, so that the schedule lifecycle is properly closed.
- **Role**: Claims Operations Manager
- **Action**: manage the complete lifecycle of dental payment schedules from creation through activation, execution, suspension/cancellation, and completion
- **Value**: payment schedules are properly controlled, monitored, and automatically closed when all payments have been generated, ensuring financial accuracy and operational efficiency

**Description:**

> **As a** Claims Operations Manager,
> **I want to** manage the complete lifecycle of dental payment schedules from creation through activation, execution, suspension/cancellation, and completion,
> **so that** payment schedules are properly controlled, monitored, and automatically closed when all payments have been generated, ensuring financial accuracy and operational efficiency.


**Key Capabilities:**

> 1. **Payment Schedule Creation**: System builds new payment schedules from approved settlement data by collecting payment template information, validating settlement conditions, creating payment templates in 'Open' status, and initiating rule-based scheduling.
>    1.1 Settlement validation ensures status is 'Approved', calculated proposal code is 'Pay', and origin source matches input requirements before proceeding.
>    1.2 If validation fails, system returns specific error messages indicating the validation failure reason and terminates the process.
> 2. **Payment Schedule Activation**: System activates payment schedules to enable payment generation by transitioning status from 'Open' to 'Active'.
>    2.1 System validates that no other schedules with status 'Active' or 'Suspended' exist for the same origin source before allowing activation.
>    2.2 System applies payment authority rules as defined in business rules for claim payment schedule activation.
>    2.3 If authority validation fails or duplicate active schedules exist, activation is blocked with appropriate error messaging.
>    2.4 Manual activation command is available to override automatic activation when system automation fails due to authority or privilege constraints.
> 3. **Payment Generation Execution**: While payment schedule remains in 'Active' status, the Payment Generation Job automatically generates scheduled payments according to the defined schedule.
> 4. **Payment Schedule Suspension and Resumption**: System provides capability to temporarily halt payment generation by suspending schedules.
>    4.1 Suspend operation transitions schedule from 'Active' to 'Suspended' status, preventing payment generation.
>    4.2 Unsuspend operation returns schedule from 'Suspended' to 'Active' status, resuming payment generation.
> 5. **Payment Schedule Cancellation**: System permanently terminates payment schedules by transitioning to 'Canceled' status from any operational state (Open, Active, Suspended).
> 6. **Automatic Payment Schedule Completion**: When all scheduled payments have been generated, system automatically executes completion command to transition schedule from 'Active' to 'Completed' status, properly closing the schedule lifecycle.
> 7. **Bulk Payment Schedule Management**: System enables mass operations on multiple payment schedules sharing the same origin source.
>    7.1 Bulk cancel operation searches for schedules in 'Active' or 'Suspended' status and executes cancel command for each match.
>    7.2 Bulk suspend operation searches for schedules in 'Active' status and executes suspend command for each match.
>    7.3 Bulk unsuspend operation searches for schedules in 'Suspended' status and executes unsuspend command for each match.
>    7.4 If no schedules match the search and filter criteria, bulk operation completes without executing commands.


**Acceptance Criteria:**

> 1. **Given** settlement data is submitted for payment schedule creation **When** settlement status is 'Approved', proposal code is 'Pay', and origin source matches input **Then** system successfully creates payment template in 'Open' status and initiates payment schedule creation.
> 2. **Given** settlement validation is performed **When** settlement status is not 'Approved' **Then** system returns error message 'Cannot resolve financial data for settlement &lt;settlement uri&gt;. Settlement state is not 'Approved'.' and terminates process without creating payment schedule.
> 3. **Given** settlement validation is performed **When** settlement calculated proposal code is not 'Pay' **Then** system returns error message 'Cannot resolve financial data for settlement &lt;settlement uri&gt;. Settlement proposal code is not 'PAY'.' and terminates process.
> 4. **Given** settlement validation is performed **When** settlement origin source differs from input origin source **Then** system returns error message 'Settlement is from a different origin source: &lt;settlement uri&gt;' and terminates process.
> 5. **Given** payment schedule in 'Open' status exists **When** activate command is executed and no other 'Active' or 'Suspended' schedules exist for same origin source **Then** system transitions schedule to 'Active' status and enables payment generation.
> 6. **Given** payment schedule activation is attempted **When** another schedule with same origin source already exists in 'Active' or 'Suspended' status **Then** system displays error 'Active or suspended payment schedule already exists for the origin source: &lt;origin source&gt;' and prevents activation.
> 7. **Given** payment schedule activation is attempted **When** payment authority rules validation fails **Then** system blocks activation and prevents status transition.
> 8. **Given** payment schedule is in 'Active' status **When** Payment Generation Job executes **Then** system automatically generates scheduled payments according to defined schedule.
> 9. **Given** payment schedule is in 'Active' status **When** suspend command is executed **Then** system transitions schedule to 'Suspended' status and halts payment generation.
> 10. **Given** payment schedule is in 'Suspended' status **When** unsuspend command is executed **Then** system transitions schedule back to 'Active' status and resumes payment generation.
> 11. **Given** payment schedule is in 'Open', 'Active', or 'Suspended' status **When** cancel command is executed **Then** system transitions schedule to 'Canceled' status and permanently terminates schedule.
> 12. **Given** payment schedule is in 'Active' status **When** all scheduled payments have been generated **Then** system automatically executes complete command and transitions schedule to 'Completed' status.
> 13. **Given** bulk cancel operation is initiated with origin source **When** system searches for matching schedules **Then** cancel command is automatically executed for all schedules in 'Active' or 'Suspended' status matching that origin source.
> 14. **Given** bulk suspend operation is initiated with origin source **When** system searches for matching schedules **Then** suspend command is automatically executed for all schedules in 'Active' status matching that origin source.
> 15. **Given** bulk unsuspend operation is initiated with origin source **When** system searches for matching schedules **Then** unsuspend command is automatically executed for all schedules in 'Suspended' status matching that origin source.
> 16. **Given** bulk operation is initiated **When** no schedules match the origin source and status filter criteria **Then** system completes operation without executing any commands and without errors.

- **Role**: Claims Adjuster
- **Action**: view and manage EOB (Explanation of Benefits) remarks on payment allocations
- **Value**: I can provide clear explanations to claimants about their payment details and claim decisions

**Description:**

> **As a** Claims Adjuster,
> **I want to** view and manage EOB (Explanation of Benefits) remarks on payment allocations,
> **so that** I can provide clear explanations to claimants about their payment details and claim decisions.


**Key Capabilities:**

> [
>   "1. The system automatically generates EOB remarks on each allocation when payment is created during claim processing.",
>   "2. Automated EOB remarks are generated by OpenL rules that evaluate claim processing scenarios including:",
>   "  2.1 Age reduction applications with dynamic percentage calculations",
>   "  2.2 Face value overrides on claims",
>   "  2.3 Wellness coverage auto-generated payments via payment automation",

>   "2. Given a claim has a face value override,",
>   "   When the payment allocation is created,",
>   "   Then the system automatically attaches an EOB remark (AutoEOB004) indicating the face value has been overridden.",
>   "3. Given a wellness coverage payment is auto-created via payment automation,",
>   "   When the allocation is generated,",
>   "   Then the system automatically adds an EOB remark (AutoEOB005) explaining the auto-generated payment determination.",
>   "**Scenario 2: Manual EOB Remark Addition**",
>   "4. Given a claims adjuster is processing a payment during the payment creation process,",
>   "   When the adjuster selects a manual EOB remark from the pre-defined list (e.g., EOB001 for guardian payments),",
>   "   Then the selected remark is attached to the allocation with the corresponding message.",
>   "5. Given the payee is a guardian and 'On behalf of' is selected,",
>   "   When the adjuster adds manual remark EOB001,",
>   "   Then the allocation displays 'Payment is made to the guardian' as the EOB explanation.",
>   "6. Given a claim salary amount has been adjusted (DI claim),",
>   "   When the adjuster adds manual remark EOB002,",
>   "   Then the allocation shows 'Your gross allowable benefit has been adjusted per your contract.'",
>   "**Scenario 3: Custom EOB Remark Entry**",
>   "7. Given none of the pre-defined EOB remarks adequately explain the payment decision,",
>   "   When the adjuster selects the 'OTHER' remark code (EOB003),",
>   "   Then the system allows the adjuster to enter custom text manually to provide situation-specific explanations.",
>   "8. Given custom text is entered for the 'OTHER' remark code,",
>   "   When the payment allocation is saved,",
>   "   Then the custom EOB text is attached to the allocation and visible to the claimant.",
>   "**Scenario 4: EOB Remark Viewing**",
>   "9. Given an allocation has EOB remarks (automated or manual),",
>   "   When the claims adjuster views the payment allocation details,",
>   "   Then all associated EOB remarks are displayed with their corresponding messages.",
>   "10. Given multiple EOB remarks exist on a single allocation,",

#### Feature: As a Claims Adjuster, I want to integrate cash management calculations for death and accelerated death benefits into settlement processing, so that benefit amounts are accurately calculated and applied to payment allocations.
- **Role**: Claims Adjuster
- **Action**: integrate cash management calculations for death and accelerated death benefits into settlement processing
- **Value**: benefit amounts are accurately calculated and applied to payment allocations

**Description:**

> **As a** Claims Adjuster,
> **I want to** integrate cash management calculations for death and accelerated death benefits into settlement processing,
> **so that** benefit amounts are accurately calculated and applied to payment allocations.


**Key Capabilities:**

> 1. System triggers settlement readjudication for Death or Accelerated Death benefit claims.
> 2. Settlement handler invokes Cash Management integration service to retrieve calculated benefit amounts.
> 3. Integration service calls appropriate Cash Management REST API endpoints based on settlement type:
>    3.1 For Accelerated Death Benefits: calls /calculate/acceleratedDeathBenefit API.
>    3.2 For Death Benefits: calls /calculate/deathBenefitValues API.
> 4. System receives and processes calculation details from Cash Management including deathBenefit, adbAmount, indebtedness, and restoredDeathBenefit values.
> 5. Calculated amounts are automatically prefilled into settlement entity:
>    5.1 For Accelerated Death: populates cashAmountsADBInfo with adbAmount, deathBenefit, indebtedness, and restoredDeathBenefit.
>    5.2 For Death settlements: populates cashAmountsDBInfo with deathBenefit, indebtedness, and restoredDeathBenefit.
> 6. Readjudication executes benefit calculations using GBA formulas with integrated gross amounts:
>    6.1 Death Settlement applies formula DB005 using integrated deathBenefit value.
>    6.2 Accelerated Settlement applies formula ABO02 using integrated adbAmount value.
> 7. System applies financial adjustments to payment allocations:
>    7.1 Applies indebtedness as payment reduction (ReductionType: INDEBTEDNESS).
>    7.2 Applies restored death benefit as payment addition (AdditionType: RESTORE).
> 8. System calculates net payment using formula: NET = AGBA - indebtedness + restore + Interest - Deductions - FICA Taxes - Federal Taxes:
>    8.1 For claims with multiple payment allocations for ADB coverage: uses allocation-specific gross and net amounts for each coverage allocation.
>    8.2 For Term Life products: processes with claimType='TL' and policy source=TermLife while maintaining same calculation logic.
> 9. Upon settlement approval, system publishes settlement approval events to appropriate event topics:
>    9.1 For Death settlements: publishes DeathSettlement_approveSettlement event to g_events_cap_deathsettlement topic.
>    9.2 For Accelerated Death settlements: publishes AcceleratedSettlement_approveSettlement event to g_events_cap_acceleratedsettlement topic.
>    9.3 Events include grossAmount and accumulator details for downstream reserve creation.
> 10. When payment definitions are issued, system publishes payment issuance events:
>    10.1 For standard payments: publishes PaymentDefinition_issuePayment event to g_events_cap_paymentdefinition topic.
>    10.2 For underpayment scenarios: publishes PaymentDefinition_issueUnderpayment event with allocation-specific amounts.
> 11. System loads accumulator details for reserve creation using current accumulator API endpoint.


**Acceptance Criteria:**

> 1. **Given** a Permanent Life claim with Death loss type and valid policy number,
>    **When** settlement readjudication is triggered,
>    **Then** the system calls Cash Management /calculate/deathBenefitValues API and populates cashAmountsDBInfo with deathBenefit, indebtedness, and restoredDeathBenefit values within 3 seconds.
>
> 2. **Given** a Permanent Life claim with Accelerated Death loss type,
>    **When** settlement readjudication is triggered,
>    **Then** the system calls Cash Management /calculate/acceleratedDeathBenefit API and populates cashAmountsADBInfo with adbAmount, deathBenefit, indebtedness, and restoredDeathBenefit values.
>
> 3. **Given** Cash Management returns calculated amounts for a Death settlement,
>    **When** readjudication executes,
>    **Then** the system applies GBA formula DB005 using the integrated deathBenefit value as gross amount.
>
> 4. **Given** Cash Management returns calculated amounts for an Accelerated Death settlement,
>    **When** readjudication executes,
>    **Then** the system applies GBA formula ABO02 using the integrated adbAmount value as gross amount.
>
> 5. **Given** indebtedness amount is returned from Cash Management,
>    **When** payment allocations are calculated,
>    **Then** the system applies indebtedness as a payment reduction with ReductionType code 'INDEBTEDNESS'.
>
> 6. **Given** restored death benefit amount is returned from Cash Management,
>    **When** payment allocations are calculated,
>    **Then** the system applies restored death benefit as a payment addition with AdditionType code 'RESTORE'.
>
> 7. **Given** all financial adjustments are applied,
>    **When** net payment is calculated,
>    **Then** the system computes: NET = AGBA - indebtedness + restore + Interest - Deductions - FICA Taxes - Federal Taxes.
>
> 8. **Given** an Accelerated Death claim has multiple payment allocations for ADB coverage,
>    **When** payment events are published,
>    **Then** the system uses allocation-specific allocationGrossAmount and allocationNetAmount for each ADB coverage allocation instead of overall payment amounts.
>
> 9. **Given** a Death settlement is approved,
>    **When** settlement approval is processed,
>    **Then** the system publishes DeathSettlement_approveSettlement event to g_events_cap_deathsettlement topic including grossAmount and accumulator details.
>
> 10. **Given** an Accelerated Death settlement is approved,
>     **When** settlement approval is processed,
>     **Then** the system publishes AcceleratedSettlement_approveSettlement event to g_events_cap_acceleratedsettlement topic including grossAmount and accumulator details.
>
> 11. **Given** a payment definition is issued for regular payment,
>     **When** payment issuance is triggered,
>     **Then** the system publishes PaymentDefinition_issuePayment event to g_events_cap_paymentdefinition topic with allocation-specific amounts.
>
> 12. **Given** a payment definition is issued for underpayment,
>     **When** payment issuance is triggered,
>     **Then** the system publishes PaymentDefinition_issueUnderpayment event to g_events_cap_paymentdefinition topic.
>
> 13. **Given** a Term Life claim with Accelerated Death loss type,
>     **When** settlement is processed,
>     **Then** the system sets claimType='TL', lossType='AcceleratedDeath', and policy source=TermLife in event metadata.
>
> 14. **Given** accumulator details are needed for reserve creation,
>     **When** system loads accumulators,
>     **Then** the system uses GET /api/capaccumulatorcontainer/CapAccumulatorContainer/v1/accumulator/loadAccumulators/\{policyNumber\} endpoint (not deprecated POST endpoint).
>
> 15. **Given** Cash Management APIs are unavailable,
>     **When** settlement readjudication is triggered,
>     **Then** the system displays an error message indicating integration failure and prevents settlement processing until connectivity is restored.
>
> 16. **Given** a claim type is not PL or TL,
>     **When** settlement integration is attempted,
>     **Then** the system bypasses Cash Management integration and processes settlement using standard calculation methods.
>
> 17. **Given** a Permanent Life claim for GPLUIndividual product,
>     **When** settlement is processed,
>     **Then** the system successfully integrates with Cash Management and completes all calculation and event publishing steps.
>
> 18. **Given** required claim type, loss type, or policy product information is missing,
>     **When** settlement readjudication is initiated,
>     **Then** the system displays validation errors identifying missing required data and blocks settlement processing.

>    2.1 For Death settlements, system retrieves deathBenefit, indebtedness, and restoredDeathBenefit via /calculate/deathBenefitValues endpoint.
>    2.2 For Accelerated Death settlements, system retrieves adbAmount, deathBenefit, indebtedness, and restoredDeathBenefit via /calculate/acceleratedDeathBenefit endpoint.
>    2.3 For Term Life policies (future scope), system uses Term Life policy source URI and claimType='TL' with lossType='AcceleratedDeath'.
> 3. System prefills Settlement entity with retrieved calculation data during readjudication, storing amounts in cashAmountsDBInfo and cashAmountsADBInfo attributes.
> 4. System calculates gross benefit amount using integrated data through OpenL adjudication formulas (DB005 for Death, ABO02 for Accelerated Death).
> 5. System maps Cash Management calculation details to financial adjustment entities when Death or AcceleratedDeath Settlement is selected as payment allocation.
>    5.1 Indebtedness values are mapped to Payment Reduction with ReductionType: INDEBTEDNESS, which decreases the payment amount.
>    5.2 Restored Death Benefit values are mapped to Payment Addition with AdditionType: RESTORE, which increases the payment amount.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

> 1. **Given** a Claims Adjuster is readjudicating a Death settlement for a Permanent Life policy (GPLUIndividual or GPLUMaster), **when** the system initiates integration with Cash Management, **then** the system successfully retrieves deathBenefit, indebtedness, and restoredDeathBenefit values and populates cashAmountsDBInfo within the Settlement entity.
> 2. **Given** a Claims Adjuster is readjudicating an AcceleratedDeath settlement for a Permanent Life policy, **when** the system initiates integration with Cash Management, **then** the system successfully retrieves adbAmount, deathBenefit, indebtedness, and restoredDeathBenefit values and populates cashAmountsADBInfo within the Settlement entity.
> 3. **Given** Cash Management integration is invoked, **when** the REST API call is made to /calculate/deathBenefitValues or /calculate/acceleratedDeathBenefit, **then** the system receives a response containing all required calculation details within acceptable performance thresholds (TBC).
> 4. **Given** indebtedness data is retrieved from Cash Management, **when** the payment allocation is calculated, **then** the system creates a Payment Reduction entity with ReductionType: INDEBTEDNESS that decreases the net payment amount by the indebtedness value.
> 5. **Given** restored death benefit data is retrieved from Cash Management, **when** the payment allocation is calculated, **then** the system creates a Payment Addition entity with AdditionType: RESTORE that increases the net payment amount by the restored death benefit value.
> 6. **Given** all financial adjustments are mapped, **when** the net payment calculation is performed, **then** the system calculates: NET = AGBA - indebtedness + restore + Interest - Deductions - FICA Taxes - Federal Taxes.
> 7. **Given** the Claims Adjuster views the payment allocation screen, **when** the payment details are displayed, **then** the UI shows all components including Total Allocation, Indemnity, Interest, Deductions, Indebtedness (as reduction), Restored Death Benefit (as addition), and Total Payment Amount with clear labeling.
> 8. **Given** a Death or AcceleratedDeath settlement is approved, **when** the settlement approval action is completed, **then** the system publishes a DeathSettlement_approveSettlement or AcceleratedSettlement_approveSettlement event to Cash Management with final grossAmount and accumulator details.
> 9. **Given** a payment is issued for a Death or AcceleratedDeath settlement, **when** the payment issuance is completed, **then** the system publishes a PaymentDefinition_issuePayment event to Cash Management for tracking (regular payment scope only).
> 10. **Given** a payment contains multiple allocations including an ADB allocation, **when** the payment issuance event is published, **then** the system uses allocationGrossAmount/allocationNetAmount for the specific ADB allocation rather than the total payment amount.
> 11. **Given** Cash Management integration fails or returns incomplete data, **when** the adjuster attempts to proceed with settlement, **then** the system displays an error message and prevents settlement approval until valid calculation data is obtained.
> 12. **Given** OpenL formula DB005 or ABO02 is invoked, **when** gross benefit amount is calculated, **then** the formula uses deathBenefit or adbAmount from the integrated Cash Management data respectively.

**Description:**

> **As a** Claims Adjuster,
> **I want to** adjust pet claim payments with addition and reduction types, manage payment approvals, and process underpayments,
> **so that** payment amounts can be corrected based on claim adjustments or policy requirements, ensuring accurate financial settlements.


**Key Capabilities:**

> 1. User accesses the Claim Overview page and navigates to the Financials tab to view payment information.
> 2. System displays payments in the payment list with appropriate status indicators (Pending Approval, Pending Post, Approved, Cancelled, Issued, Request Stopped, Failed) based on authority validation results.
> 3. User reviews payment details by expanding payment items to view comprehensive payment information.
> 4. When authority validation passes, system automatically progresses payment through posting and issuance workflow.
>    4.1 If authority validation fails, system sets payment status to Pending Approval and generates 'Require For Authority Limit Approve' task assigned to Claim Management queue.
>    4.2 User with sufficient authority can authorize pending payments through the Authority Approval action, changing status to Pending Post.
>    4.3 User without sufficient authority attempting approval receives error notification and payment remains in Pending Approval status.
> 5. User can adjust payments that are in eligible status by selecting 'Adjust Payment' action from the payment action dropdown.
>    5.1 System hides adjustment option when payment is not yet scheduled, or latest payment is completed, or addition/reduction has been issued or stopped.
> 6. User can cancel payments in Pending Post or Pending Approval status through the 'Cancel Payment(s)' action.
>    6.1 System prompts confirmation before executing cancellation.
>    6.2 Upon confirmation, payment status changes to Cancelled and is removed from the payment list.
> 7. User can disapprove previously approved payments, which updates payment status to Cancelled and marks payment with indicator showing disapproval.
>    7.1 If claim is subsequently adjusted (services added, charges increased), system automatically recreates the disapproved payment based on new payment date for original services.
> 8. When claim adjustments trigger payment rescheduling, system recreates posted payments based on updated payment schedule creation dates.
> 9. User initiates underpayment processing via Balance action when payment discrepancies are identified.
>    9.1 System creates underpayment record and displays it in the payment list.
>    9.2 When authority validation passes, system automatically posts and issues the underpayment.
>    9.3 When authority validation fails, user with sufficient authority must approve the underpayment before posting and issuance.
>    9.4 User can disapprove underpayment, changing its status to Cancelled.
> 10. System maintains payment status throughout lifecycle and ensures appropriate actions are available based on current status and user authority level.


**Acceptance Criteria:**

> 1. Given a user with valid credentials opens a Claim, When they navigate to the Financials tab, Then the system displays the Payments sub-tab with all relevant payment items within 2 seconds.
> 2. Given a payment is created and authority validation passes, When the system evaluates the payment, Then the payment displays with 'Pending Post' (Active lifecycle) status and progresses automatically through posting and issuance.
> 3. Given a payment is created and authority validation fails, When the system evaluates the payment, Then the payment displays with 'Pending Approval' (Open lifecycle) status and task 'Require For Authority Limit Approve' is generated and assigned to Claim Management queue.
> 4. Given a payment is in Pending Approval status and user has sufficient authority, When the user clicks 'Authority Approval' and confirms authorization, Then the payment status changes to 'Pending Post' and proceeds through standard workflow.
> 5. Given a payment is in Pending Approval status and user lacks sufficient authority, When the user attempts to authorize the payment, Then the system displays error 'You do not have the authority to approve the payments' and payment status remains unchanged.
> 6. Given a payment is in Pending Post status, When the user selects 'Cancel Payment(s)' action and confirms cancellation, Then the payment status changes to 'Cancelled' and the payment is removed from the payment list.
> 7. Given a payment is in Approved status, When the user selects 'Disapprove Payment' and confirms action, Then the payment status changes to 'Cancelled' and system displays 'Expression Mark' indicator with tooltip 'Payment is disapproved.'
> 8. Given a payment has been disapproved and claim is subsequently adjusted, When payment rescheduling is triggered, Then the system recreates (posts) the disapproved payment based on the new payment date for the original service(s).
> 9. Given 'Adjust Payment' action is requested, When payment is not yet scheduled, or latest payment is completed, or addition/reduction has been issued/stopped, Then the system hides the 'Adjust Payment(s)' option from available actions.
> 10. Given a user triggers 'Pay Underpayment' via Balance action, When the underpayment is created and authority validation passes, Then the system displays the underpayment with 'Approved' status and automatically posts and issues the underpayment.
> 11. Given an underpayment is created and authority validation fails, When a user with sufficient authority clicks 'Approve Payment' and confirms, Then the payment status changes to 'Approved' and proceeds to automatic posting and issuance.
> 12. Given an underpayment is in Pending Approval status and user lacks sufficient authority, When the user attempts to approve, Then the system displays error 'User authority level is not enough to approve the payment' and status remains 'Pending Approval'.
> 13. Given an underpayment is pending approval, When the user clicks 'Disapprove Payment' and confirms, Then the payment status changes to 'Cancelled'.

#### Feature: As a Claims Adjuster, I want to pay underpayments and waive overpayments through balance actions, so that I can resolve claim balance discrepancies and complete claim settlement.
- **Role**: Claims Adjuster
- **Action**: pay underpayments and waive overpayments through balance actions
- **Value**: I can resolve claim balance discrepancies and complete claim settlement

**Description:**

> **As a** Claims Adjuster,
> **I want to** pay underpayments and waive overpayments through balance actions,
> **so that** I can resolve claim balance discrepancies and complete claim settlement.


**Key Capabilities:**

> 1. User navigates to Balance Tab under Claim Overview - Financials section to view balance information.
> 2. System displays Total Balance per Claim summary showing current balance status as overpayment (negative/red), underpayment (positive), zero, or N/A based on discrepancies between actual payments and recalculated scheduled amounts.
> 3. User reviews chronological Balance Activities List showing complete log of all balance-related transactions including recalculations, underpayments, overpayment waives, and recoveries.
> 4. User examines Recalculated Payments List displaying only payments where 'Should Have Paid' amount differs from actual 'Payment Amount', with summary totals for both values.
> 5. User expands individual payment rows to view detailed allocation information including payment date, ID, transaction entities, gross amounts, balance adjustments, and calculated payment balance.
> 6. User drills down to Service Details level to examine granular service-specific information formatted by claim type (Injury/Illness/Preventive Care/Medical Supplies) with gross amounts comparing actual versus scheduled payments.
> 7. Based on balance type and claim status, user selects appropriate corrective action from Balance Action Dropdown to resolve discrepancies.
>    7.1. **For Positive Underpayment**: User selects 'Pay Underpayment' action, completes underpayment processing in drawer, and system records transaction with Underpayment number in Balance Activities with Type 'Issue Underpayment' and recalculates total balance.
>    7.2. **For Negative Overpayment**: User selects 'Waive Overpayment' action, enters comments/reasons for waiving in drawer, and system records transaction with Overpayment Waive number in Balance Activities with Type 'Init Overpayment Waive', status 'Issued', and description containing waive reason.
>    7.3. **For Issued Overpayment Waive**: User selects 'Cancel Waive Overpayment' action (enabled only when Issued waive exists), enters cancellation reason, and system records cancellation transaction with Type 'Cancel Overpayment Waive' and reverses the waive in balance calculation.
>    7.4. **For Closed Claims**: System hides Balance Action Dropdown entirely, restricting users to read-only view of balance information without ability to take corrective actions.
> 8. System continuously recalculates and updates Total Balance reflecting all balance activities, payment adjustments, and corrective actions taken.


**Acceptance Criteria:**

> 1. **Given** a claim with payment discrepancies exists, **When** user navigates to Balance Tab, **Then** system displays Total Balance per Claim as 'Overpayment' in red negative format (e.g., ($217.00)) for negative values, positive amount for underpayments, $0.00 for zero balance, or 'N/A' with label for null values.
> 2. **Given** Balance Activities exist for a claim, **When** user views Balance Activities List, **Then** system displays transactions in chronological order with Transaction Date, Transaction ID (format varies: Underpayment # as U1, Overpayment Waive # as W1, Recovery # as R1, 'N/A' for Recalculation), Type from lookup LU>CapPetBalanceLogTransactionType, Transaction Amount calculated as current total balance minus previous total balance displayed in red for negative values, Description containing comments/reasons or blank, and continuously calculated Total Balance.
> 3. **Given** payments exist on a claim, **When** user views Recalculated Payments List, **Then** system displays only payments where 'Should Have Paid' ≠ 'Payment Amount' with summary showing Payment Amount (sum of actual paid) and Should Have Paid (sum of scheduled paid).
> 4. **Given** a recalculated payment entry exists, **When** user expands the payment row, **Then** system displays Payment Date (post date for allocation), system-generated Payment ID, Transaction Type entities, gross amounts, Balance Adjustment calculated as balancedNetAmount minus actualNetAmount labeled 'Incoming' for negative or 'Outgoing' for positive, and Payment Balance calculated as Should have paid minus Actual Paid.
> 5. **Given** a payment has service details, **When** user drills down to Service Details level, **Then** system displays information formatted as &lt;Claim Type&gt;_&lt;Service Type&gt;(Date) where format varies by claim type: Injury uses 'Type of Injury', Illness uses 'Type of Condition', Preventive Care uses 'Wellness Type', Medical Supplies uses 'Type of Injury' with Date Purchased instead of Date of Service, showing Total Allocation gross amounts for actual versus scheduled payments.
> 6. **Given** claim has positive underpayment balance and claim is not closed, **When** user clicks Balance Action Dropdown, **Then** 'Pay Underpayment' option is enabled and available for selection.
> 7. **Given** user selects 'Pay Underpayment' and completes processing, **When** transaction is recorded, **Then** system creates Balance Activities entry with Underpayment # (e.g., U1), Type 'Issue Underpayment', calculated Transaction Amount as current total balance minus previous total balance, and updates Total Balance to reflect underpayment correction.
> 8. **Given** claim has negative balance (overpayment) and Total Balance per Payee is not 'N/A' and claim is not closed, **When** user clicks Balance Action Dropdown, **Then** 'Waive Overpayment' option is enabled and available for selection.
> 9. **Given** user selects 'Waive Overpayment' and enters comments/reasons, **When** waive is processed, **Then** system creates Balance Activities entry with Overpayment Waive # (e.g., W1), Type 'Init Overpayment Waive', status 'Issued', Transaction Amount in red negative format, Description field populated with entered comments/reasons (truncated with ellipsis and tooltip if exceeds display limit), and recalculates Total Balance.
> 10. **Given** Overpayment Waive exists in Issued status and claim is not closed, **When** user clicks Balance Action Dropdown, **Then** 'Cancel Waive Overpayment' option is enabled and available for selection.
> 11. **Given** user selects 'Cancel Waive Overpayment' and enters cancellation reason, **When** cancellation is processed, **Then** system creates Balance Activities entry with Type 'Cancel Overpayment Waive', Description showing cancellation reason, and recalculates Total Balance to reverse the waive action.
> 12. **Given** claim status is closed, **When** user views Balance Tab, **Then** Balance Action Dropdown is hidden entirely and user can only view balance information without ability to take corrective actions.
> 13. **Given** Transaction Type is Recalculation in Balance Activities, **When** transaction is displayed, **Then** Transaction ID shows as 'N/A', Description field remains blank, and Type displays from lookup (e.g., 'Init Payment Schedule').
> 14. **Given** Transaction Type is Recovery in Balance Activities, **When** transaction is displayed, **Then** Transaction ID shows in Recovery # format (e.g., R1) and Type displays as 'Init Recovery' or 'Cancel Recovery' as applicable.
> 15. **Given** user locale is set to en_GB (United Kingdom), **When** balance information is displayed, **Then** currency symbol displays as £ instead of $ and date format displays as DD/MM/YYYY instead of MM/DD/YYYY throughout all date fields.
> 16. **Given** Total Balance value exceeds 11 digits, **When** balance is displayed, **Then** system truncates display with ellipsis for overflow while preserving full value in backend.
> 17. **Given** payment has 'Should Have Paid' = 'Payment Amount' (no balance difference), **When** Recalculated Payments List is generated, **Then** system excludes this payment from the list (filter applies to both payments and interest components).
> 18. **Given** balance calculation APIs return data, **When** Total Balance per Claim is calculated, **Then** system sums all payment balances from CapBalance API and retrieves transaction log from CapBalanceChangeLog API using business rule BR>Pet Financial Transaction Number Generation (Claim) for transaction numbering.

#### Feature: As a Claims Examiner, I want to authorize or cancel payments pending approval based on authority limits, so that I can ensure proper payment governance and compliance with claim authorization policies.
- **Role**: Claims Examiner
- **Action**: authorize or cancel payments pending approval based on authority limits, and manage the complete payment lifecycle including posting, issuing, adjusting, disapproving, and rescheduling payments
- **Value**: proper payment governance and compliance with claim authorization policies are maintained throughout the claim financial management process

**Description:**

> **As a** Claims Examiner,
> **I want to** authorize or cancel payments pending approval based on authority limits, and manage the complete payment lifecycle including posting, issuing, adjusting, disapproving, and rescheduling payments,
> **so that** proper payment governance and compliance with claim authorization policies are maintained throughout the claim financial management process.


**Key Capabilities:**

> 1. User accesses claim financials and views the payment list with current payment statuses.
> 2. System performs authority validation for each payment:
>    2.1. If authority validation passes, payment displays with **Pending Post** status and proceeds to automatic posting and issuance.
>    2.2. If authority validation fails, payment displays with **Pending Approval** status and system generates task 'Require For Authority Limit Approve' assigned to Claim Management queue.
> 3. For payments requiring approval (Pending Approval status):
>    3.1. User with sufficient authority level can authorize the payment, changing status to **Pending Post** and resuming standard payment processing.
>    3.2. User with insufficient authority attempting approval receives error notification and payment remains in **Pending Approval** status.
>    3.3. User can cancel the payment after review, changing status to **Cancelled** and removing it from the payment list.
> 4. User manages posted payments (Pending Post status):
>    4.1. User can cancel payments before issuance via confirmation workflow.
>    4.2. User can adjust payments if conditions allow (payment scheduled, not yet completed, no issued additions/reductions applied).
> 5. System posts and issues payments automatically following standard processing workflow.
> 6. User can disapprove issued payments that are in **Approved** status:
>    6.1. Disapproval changes payment status to **Cancelled** with explanatory indicator.
>    6.2. If claim is subsequently adjusted (services added or charge amounts increased), system automatically triggers payment rescheduling and recreates the disapproved payment with new payment date.
> 7. System processes underpayments triggered by user action:
>    7.1. System performs authority validation for underpayment.
>    7.2. If authority validation passes, underpayment displays with **Approved** status and system automatically posts and issues payment.
>    7.3. If authority validation fails, user with sufficient authority can manually approve underpayment, or user can disapprove it changing status to **Cancelled**.
> 8. System maintains payment lifecycle states and displays updated financial information reflecting all payment actions and status changes.


**Acceptance Criteria:**

> 1. **Given** a payment is created for a claim, **When** authority validation is performed, **Then** the system displays payment status as **Pending Post** if user authority is sufficient, or **Pending Approval** if authority is insufficient.
> 2. **Given** a payment is in **Pending Approval** status, **When** the system performs authority validation, **Then** a task 'Require For Authority Limit Approve' is automatically generated and assigned to the Claim Management queue.
> 3. **Given** a user with sufficient authority views a payment in **Pending Approval** status, **When** the user clicks 'Authority Approval' and confirms authorization, **Then** the payment status changes to **Pending Post** and standard payment processing resumes.
> 4. **Given** a user with insufficient authority attempts to approve a payment in **Pending Approval** status, **When** the user clicks 'Authority Approval', **Then** the system displays error message 'You do not have the authority to approve the payments' and payment status remains **Pending Approval**.
> 5. **Given** a payment is in **Pending Approval** or **Pending Post** status, **When** the user selects 'Cancel Payment(s)' action and confirms cancellation, **Then** the payment status changes to **Cancelled** and the payment is removed from the payment list.
> 6. **Given** a payment is in **Pending Post** status and meets adjustment conditions, **When** the user selects 'Adjust Payment' action, **Then** the system navigates to the payment adjustment workflow.
> 7. **Given** a payment has not been scheduled, or the latest payment is completed (Issued/Request Stopped/Failed), or addition/reduction applied has been Issued/Request Stopped, **When** the user views payment actions, **Then** the 'Adjust Payment(s)' action is hidden from the dropdown list.
> 8. **Given** a payment is in **Approved** status, **When** the user clicks 'Disapprove Payment' action and confirms, **Then** the system executes cancelPayment command, changes payment status to **Cancelled**, and displays an expression mark with tooltip 'Payment is disapproved.'
> 9. **Given** a payment has been disapproved and the claim is subsequently adjusted (services added or charge amounts increased), **When** payment rescheduling is triggered, **Then** the system automatically creates (posts) the disapproved payment again based on the new payment date for the original service(s).
> 10. **Given** an underpayment is created via 'Pay Underpayment' action, **When** authority validation passes, **Then** the system displays underpayment with **Approved** status and automatically posts and issues the payment.
> 11. **Given** an underpayment requires approval and user has sufficient authority, **When** the user clicks 'Approve Payment' and confirms, **Then** the payment status changes to **Approved** and automatic posting and issuance proceed.
> 12. **Given** an underpayment requires approval and user has insufficient authority, **When** the user attempts to approve, **Then** the system displays error message 'User authority level is not enough to approve the payment' and payment status remains **Pending Approval**.
> 13. **Given** an underpayment is in **Pending Approval** status, **When** the user clicks 'Disapprove Payment' and confirms, **Then** the payment status changes to **Cancelled**.
> 14. **Given** any payment action is completed, **When** the user views the Financials tab, **Then** the system displays updated payment information with current statuses within 2 seconds.
> 15. **Given** the user lacks privilege to view financials, **When** the user attempts to access the Financials tab, **Then** the system denies access and displays appropriate authorization error.

#### Feature: As a Claims Operations Manager, I want the system to automatically generate and issue payments based on payment schedules and tiered benefit rules, so that claim payments are processed efficiently and consistently according to policy terms.
- **Role**: Claims Operations Manager
- **Action**: have the system automatically generate and issue payments based on tiered benefit schedules that adjust benefit amounts over different duration periods
- **Value**: claim payments are processed efficiently, consistently, and accurately according to policy terms, motivating claimants to return to work while preventing overpayments or underpayments

**Description:**

> **As a** Claims Operations Manager,
> **I want to** have the system automatically generate and issue payments based on tiered benefit schedules that adjust benefit amounts over different duration periods,
> **so that** claim payments are processed efficiently, consistently, and accurately according to policy terms, motivating claimants to return to work while preventing overpayments or underpayments.


**Key Capabilities:**

> [
>   "1. System retrieves tiered benefit configuration from the policy, including tier level sequence, tier type (percentage or flat amount), tier percentage or dollar value, tier maximum weekly benefit, calculated gross weekly amount, and tier duration in weeks.",
>   "2. System calculates the Gross Weekly Benefit Amount (GBA) for each tier level according to the tiered benefit calculation business rules, creating a complete tier structure (e.g., Tier 1: 60% of salary with $800/week max; Tier 2: 55% of salary with $700/week max; Tier 3: flat $300/week).",
>   "3. When generating payments, system allocates GBA amounts according to tier-based rules:",
>   "   3.1. Applies tier levels and durations in sequential order from the elimination through date forward.",
>   "   3.2. Aggregates duration based on the actual Allocation Periods (APs) selected in the current payment, not all approved APs under the settlement.",
>   "   3.3. Applies prorating rate when partial weeks are covered (e.g., multiplies GBA by number of days and applies 1/5 daily proration rate).",
>   "   3.4. For 'Single Occurrence' payment frequency, sums the GBA for the entire payment period.",
>   "4. System handles out-of-sequence payment scenarios:",
>   "   4.1. When payments are created for later Allocation Periods before earlier ones, initially applies tier amounts sequentially from the payment date.",
>   "   4.2. When earlier missing APs are subsequently paid, system recalculates all tier allocations from the elimination through date forward.",
>   "   4.3. System automatically generates balance adjustments (overpayment/underpayment records) for previously issued payments that used incorrect tier amounts due to out-of-sequence processing.",
>   "5. System issues payments with correctly calculated tiered benefit amounts, maintaining audit trail of tier application and any balance adjustments."
> ]


**Acceptance Criteria:**

> [
>   "1. **Given** a policy with a three-tier benefit structure (Tier 1: 60% salary, max $800/week for 2 weeks; Tier 2: 55% salary, max $700/week for 1 week; Tier 3: flat $300/week for 23 weeks), **When** the system calculates a payment for the first 2 weeks, **Then** the GBA is allocated using Tier 1 rates exclusively.",
>   "2. **Given** a tiered benefit claim with multiple allocation periods approved, **When** generating a payment for weeks 3-4, **Then** the system aggregates duration based only on the selected APs in that payment and applies the appropriate tier (Tier 2 then Tier 3 in this example), not all approved APs.",
>   "3. **Given** a tiered benefit payment covering a partial week (e.g., 3 days), **When** the system calculates the GBA, **Then** it applies the appropriate prorating rate (e.g., 3/5 for 3 days at 1/5 daily rate) to the tier's weekly GBA.",
>   "4. **Given** a payment with 'Single Occurrence' frequency spanning multiple weeks across different tiers, **When** the system calculates the payment amount, **Then** it sums the GBA for all weeks according to the applicable tier rates for each week.",
>   "5. **Given** a claim where a payment is created for weeks 5-6 before weeks 1-4 are paid (out-of-sequence), **When** the initial payment is generated, **Then** the system applies tier amounts sequentially from the payment date (using appropriate tier levels for weeks 5-6).",
>   "6. **Given** an out-of-sequence payment scenario where weeks 5-6 were paid first, **When** a payment for the missing weeks 1-4 is subsequently created, **Then** the system:",
>   "   6.1. Recalculates all tier allocations from the elimination through date forward.",
>   "   6.2. Identifies any discrepancies in the previously issued payment for weeks 5-6.",
>   "   6.3. Automatically generates balance adjustment records (overpayment or underpayment) to correct the previously issued payment.",
>   "7. **Given** any tiered benefit payment calculation, **When** the payment is issued, **Then** the system maintains a complete audit trail showing which tier levels were applied, the duration consumed from each tier, and the GBA allocated from each tier.",
>   "8. **Given** a tier configuration with maximum weekly benefit caps, **When** the calculated percentage-based amount exceeds the tier maximum, **Then** the system caps the GBA at the tier maximum for that tier level.",
>   "9. **Given** invalid or missing tier configuration data on the policy, **When** the system attempts to generate a payment, **Then** it prevents payment creation and provides a clear error message identifying the missing or invalid tier configuration elements.",
>   "10. **Given** a tiered benefit claim with all tier durations exhausted, **When** the system attempts to generate a payment for additional periods, **Then** it either applies the last tier indefinitely (if configured) or prevents payment generation with an appropriate business rule message."

**Key Capabilities:**

> 1. User navigates to the Payments & Recoveries section and initiates payment creation through the 'Select Payments Action' menu, which opens a two-step payment wizard (Details and Allocations).
> 2. In Step 1 - Details, user enters payment information including payee, payment method, claim association, and other payment detail information.
> 3. User calculates payment allocations by triggering the allocation preview, which validates the claim status and navigates to Step 2.
>    3.1 If claim status is not Open when calculating allocations with Indemnity Allocation Type, system displays error message and prevents progression.
>    3.2 User can navigate back to Step 1 from Step 2 using the navigation bar to modify payment details, triggering recalculation of allocations upon returning to Step 2.
> 4. In Step 2 - Allocations, user reviews and confirms or updates the calculated allocation details for the payment.
> 5. User submits the payment for creation, which triggers payment schedule building and authority validation.
>    5.1 If user lacks sufficient authority for the payment amount based on authority limits, system creates a 'Review Payment Schedule' task and assigns it to a manager with appropriate authority for approval.
> 6. Upon successful creation, payment schedule and payment allocation(s) are recorded and displayed in the Payments & Recoveries list.
> 7. User can cancel the payment creation process at any time during the wizard by clicking Cancel or X button, which exits the process without saving.


**Acceptance Criteria:**

> 5. System presents Step 2 Allocations where user reviews and confirms or updates allocation details across applicable coverages.
>    5.1 User may return to Step 1 using the navigation bar to modify payment details, triggering recalculation of allocations upon returning to Step 2.
>    5.2 User may cancel the payment creation process at any time using Cancel or X button, exiting without saving.
> 6. User submits the payment by clicking 'Create' button, triggering payment schedule creation and authority validation.
>    6.1 System retrieves the gross payment amount and validates against the user's authority limit.
>    6.2 If payment amount exceeds user's authority limit, system creates a 'Review Payment Schedule' task assigned to a manager with sufficient authority.
>    6.3 Manager with appropriate authority reviews the payment schedule and completes approval process before payment activation.
>    6.4 If payment is within authority limit, system immediately creates and activates the payment schedule.
> 7. Upon successful creation, payment allocations are displayed in the Payments & Recoveries list on the Event Case or Claim Overview page.


**Acceptance Criteria:**

> 1. **Given** a user with 'Initiate Payment Schedule' privilege on an Open Event Case with an eligible claim (Pending or Open status, Eligible validation result, Approved coverage),
>    **When** the user selects 'Create Payment' from the Payments & Recoveries section,
>    **Then** the system opens an empty two-step Payment wizard within 2 seconds.
>
> 2. **Given** the user is on Step 1 Detail of the payment wizard,
>    **When** the user completes all required payment detail fields and clicks 'Calculate' for a claim in Open status,
>    **Then** the system successfully calls Preview Payment Schedule API and advances to Step 2 Allocations displaying calculated allocation details.
>
> 3. **Given** the user is on Step 1 Detail of the payment wizard,
>    **When** the user clicks 'Calculate' for a claim that is NOT in Open status with Indemnity Allocation Type,
>    **Then** the system displays error message 'Indemnity Allocation Type is not supported when claim status is not Open' and prevents progression to Step 2.
>
> 4. **Given** the user is on Step 2 Allocations,
>    **When** the user clicks the Step 1 button on the navigation bar,
>    **Then** the system returns to Step 1 Detail preserving previously entered data, and upon clicking 'Calculate' again, recalculates allocations and returns to Step 2.
>
> 5. **Given** the user is at any point in the payment wizard,
>    **When** the user clicks 'Cancel' or 'X' button,
>    **Then** the system exits the payment creation process without saving any data and returns to the Event Case or Claim Overview page.
>
> 6. **Given** a user with authority limit of $10,000 is creating a payment,
>    **When** the user clicks 'Create' on a payment with gross amount of $8,000,
>    **Then** the system successfully creates and activates the payment schedule without creating a review task, and displays the payment allocation in the Payments & Recoveries list.
>
> 7. **Given** a user with authority limit of $10,000 is creating a payment,
>    **When** the user clicks 'Create' on a payment with gross amount of $15,000,
>    **Then** the system creates the payment schedule in pending status, generates a 'Review Payment Schedule' task assigned to a manager with sufficient authority limit, and does not activate the payment until manager approval is completed.
>
> 8. **Given** a 'Review Payment Schedule' task exists for a payment exceeding the original user's authority,
>    **When** a manager with sufficient authority limit accesses and approves the task,
>    **Then** the system activates the payment schedule and displays it in the Payments & Recoveries list with active status.
>
> 9. **Given** payment creation prerequisites are not met,
>    **When** the user attempts to create a payment,
>    **Then** the system prevents payment creation if any of the following conditions exist: Event Case status is not Open, Claim status is neither Pending nor Open, Claim eligibility validation result is not Eligible, Coverage settlement status is not Approved, or Claim type is not one of the supported types (Group Term Life, Group Critical Illness, Group Hospital Indemnity, Group Accident, Absence, Leave - NY PFL).
>
> 10. **Given** a payment schedule is successfully created,
>     **When** the system completes the buildPaymentSchedule API call,
>     **Then** the payment allocation(s) appear in the Payments & Recoveries list with correct gross amount, allocation details, and status indicator within 3 seconds.

> 5. **Given** the confirmation prompt is displayed, **When** the adjuster confirms cancellation, **Then** the system closes both the drawer and confirmation pop-up without saving any information and returns to the Balance Management view.
> 6. **Given** the confirmation prompt is displayed, **When** the adjuster does not confirm cancellation, **Then** the system closes only the confirmation pop-up and returns to the cancellation form with all entered data preserved.
> 7. **Given** a user without 'Cancel Overpayment Waive' privilege attempts to access the function, **When** they view the Balance tab, **Then** the 'Cancel Waive Overpayment' action is not available or is disabled.
> 8. **Given** an overpayment waive exists in a status other than 'Issued', **When** the adjuster views available balance actions, **Then** the 'Cancel Waive Overpayment' action is not available for that specific waive transaction.
> 9. **Given** the cancellation is successfully submitted, **When** the system completes processing, **Then** the balance is updated immediately and reflects the restored overpayment amount.

#### Feature: As a Claims Adjuster, I want to pay underpayments with optional withholding compensation, so that I can issue additional payments to claimants and manage payment withholdings.
- **Role**: Claims Adjuster
- **Action**: pay underpayments with optional withholding compensation
- **Value**: I can issue additional payments to claimants and manage payment withholdings

**Description:**

> **As a** Claims Adjuster,
> **I want to** pay underpayments with optional withholding compensation,
> **so that** I can issue additional payments to claimants and manage payment withholdings.


**Key Capabilities:**

> 1. Adjuster initiates the Pay Underpayment balance action to generate underpayment payments for a specific payee.
> 2. System presents the underpayment interface displaying the current payee (non-editable) and pre-populates the payment amount with the Total Balance per Payee.
>    2.1 Adjuster can modify the payment amount as needed within validation constraints.
>    2.2 Adjuster optionally selects 'Compensate Withholdings' option to address previously withheld amounts from overpayments.
>       2.1.1 When withholding compensation is selected, the interface switches to extended mode where the amount becomes auto-calculated and non-editable.
>       2.1.2 System displays a multi-select dropdown of issued payments that have overpayment withholdings on the case or claim, excluding any payments already adjusted by previous compensate withholding actions.
>       2.1.3 As adjuster selects payments from the dropdown, the system automatically recalculates the payment amount based on the cumulative withholding amounts of selected payments.
> 3. Adjuster submits the underpayment action, triggering the appropriate payment generation API based on whether withholding compensation was selected.
> 4. System validates payment details including payment method (CHECK/EFT), addresses, expiration dates, and amount constraints per business rules for collecting financial data.
> 5. Upon successful validation and submission, the system generates a new payment record in the Payment List, updates the payee's balance accordingly, and navigates the adjuster to the Case or Claim Overview page.
>    5.1 If adjuster cancels or closes the underpayment drawer, system displays a confirmation modal requiring explicit confirmation before discarding changes.
>    5.2 If validation fails (empty amount, negative values, or amount exceeding Total Balance per Payee when underpayment balance exists), system prevents submission and displays appropriate error messages requiring correction.


**Acceptance Criteria:**

> 1. **Given** an adjuster initiates Pay Underpayment action for a payee with underpayment balance, **When** the underpayment drawer opens, **Then** the system displays the payee name (non-editable) and pre-populates the Amount field with the Total Balance per Payee amount.
> 2. **Given** the adjuster is on the standard underpayment interface, **When** the adjuster modifies the Amount field to a valid value within the Total Balance per Payee limit, **Then** the system accepts the modified amount for submission.
> 3. **Given** the adjuster checks the 'Compensate Withholdings' checkbox, **When** the interface switches to extended mode, **Then** the Amount field becomes non-editable and auto-calculated, and the Payment Applied Withholdings multi-select dropdown appears showing only issued payments with overpayment withholdings (excluding payments already adjusted).
> 4. **Given** the adjuster is in withholding compensation mode, **When** the adjuster selects one or more payments from the Payment Applied Withholdings dropdown, **Then** the Amount field automatically updates to reflect the cumulative withholding amounts from selected payments.
> 5. **Given** the adjuster submits a standard underpayment (Compensate Withholdings unchecked), **When** all validations pass, **Then** the system calls POST /cap-adjuster/v1/financial/payment/generate-under-payment API, generates a new payment, updates the payee balance, and navigates to Case/Claim Overview page.
> 6. **Given** the adjuster submits a withholding compensation underpayment (Compensate Withholdings checked), **When** all validations pass, **Then** the system calls the Generate Withholding Underpayment API, generates a new payment, updates the payee balance, and navigates to Case/Claim Overview page.
> 7. **Given** the adjuster attempts to submit with an empty Amount field, **When** validation occurs, **Then** the system prevents submission and displays a mandatory field error message.
> 8. **Given** the adjuster enters a negative value in the Amount field, **When** validation occurs, **Then** the system prevents submission and displays an error indicating negative values are not allowed.
> 9. **Given** an underpayment balance exists and the adjuster enters an amount exceeding the Total Balance per Payee, **When** validation occurs, **Then** the system prevents submission and displays an error indicating the amount cannot exceed the total balance.
> 10. **Given** the adjuster is in withholding compensation mode and has not selected any payments from the dropdown, **When** attempting to submit, **Then** the system prevents submission and displays a mandatory field error for the Payment Applied Withholdings dropdown.
> 11. **Given** the adjuster clicks Close or Cancel buttons during underpayment entry, **When** the action is triggered, **Then** the system displays a confirmation modal requiring explicit confirmation before closing the drawer and discarding changes.
> 12. **Given** payment generation is initiated, **When** the system validates payment details, **Then** the system verifies payment method is valid (CHECK/EFT), addresses are complete and valid, and expiration dates are within acceptable ranges per business rules for collecting financial data.
> 13. **Given** a payment has already been adjusted by a previous compensate withholding action, **When** the Payment Applied Withholdings dropdown is populated, **Then** that payment is excluded from the available selection list.
> 14. **Given** the system processes currency amounts, **When** displaying the Amount field, **Then** the format is locale-sensitive ($ for en_US, £ for en_GB) according to user preferences.

- **Role**: Claims Adjuster
- **Action**: create and manage deduction payments to third parties
- **Value**: court-ordered or sponsor-based deductions from claim payments can be properly processed and distributed

**Description:**

> **As a** Claims Adjuster,
> **I want to** create and manage deduction payments to third parties,
> **so that** court-ordered or sponsor-based deductions from claim payments can be properly processed and distributed.


**Key Capabilities:**

> [
>   "1. User creates a new deduction record by specifying the deduction type and category (Sponsor-based or Non-Sponsor-based).",
>   "2. User configures deduction parameters including amount or percentage, tax treatment designation (pre-tax or post-tax), and associated party information (sponsor or third party).",
>   "3. For Sponsor-based deductions (Health & Welfare category):",
>   "  3.1. User selects from available sponsor deduction types: Insurance Premium (payroll deductions for other insurance plan premiums), Saving Accounts (FSA for flexible spending or HSA for health savings), Union Dues (contributions for wages, benefits, and representation), Other job-related deductions (merchandise, uniforms, tools, tuition, certification fees), or Other non-job-related deductions (retirement, charitable donations).",
>   "  3.2. For HSA deductions, user confirms the insured has an eligible High Deductible Health Plan (HDHP), as this is a prerequisite for HSA eligibility.",
>   "  3.3. System aggregates these deductions across all claims for the same Sponsor (Employer) for external batch payment and reporting.",
>   "4. For Non-Sponsor-based deductions (Wage Garnishment category):",
>   "  4.1. User selects garnishment type (Child Support for court custody order obligations, or Wage Garnishment for creditor garnishments, tax levies, or student loans).",
>   "  4.2. User attaches court order or official notice documentation and identifies the third-party payee.",
>   "  4.3. System automatically generates a secondary Deduction Payment payable to the designated third party.",
>   "5. User applies the deduction to claim payment calculations:",
>   "  5.1. For single disability claims, system applies the deduction as a fixed weekly or monthly amount.",

>   "  5.3. System applies pre-tax or post-tax logic based on the deduction configuration.",
>   "6. System reduces the net payment amount to the insured by the deduction amount and routes the deducted funds according to the deduction category (aggregated to sponsor or direct payment to third party).",
>   "7. User reviews and manages active deductions throughout the claim lifecycle, with visibility into deduction history and payment distribution records."
> ]


**Acceptance Criteria:**

> [
>   "1. **Given** a claims adjuster is creating a Sponsor-based Insurance Premium deduction, **When** all required parameters (amount, tax treatment, sponsor) are entered, **Then** the deduction is saved and will be aggregated with other deductions for the same sponsor for external payment processing.",
>   "2. **Given** a claims adjuster is creating an HSA Saving Account deduction, **When** the insured does not have an eligible HDHP, **Then** the system prevents creation of the HSA deduction and displays a validation error indicating HDHP eligibility is required.",
>   "3. **Given** a claims adjuster is creating a Non-Sponsor-based Child Support deduction, **When** the court order and third-party payee information are provided, **Then** the system creates the deduction and automatically generates a secondary Deduction Payment record payable to the designated third party.",
>   "4. **Given** a deduction is configured as pre-tax, **When** the deduction is applied to a claim payment calculation, **Then** the deduction amount is subtracted from the gross payment amount before tax calculations are performed.",
>   "5. **Given** a deduction is configured as post-tax, **When** the deduction is applied to a claim payment calculation, **Then** the deduction amount is subtracted from the net payment amount after tax calculations are completed.",
>   "6. **Given** a deduction is applied to a single disability claim, **When** the payment is calculated, **Then** the system applies the deduction as the configured fixed weekly or monthly amount.",
>   "7. **Given** a deduction is applied to multiple claims or a non-disability claim, **When** the payment is calculated, **Then** the system applies the deduction as the configured percentage of the payment amount.",
>   "8. **Given** multiple Sponsor-based deductions exist for different claims under the same Employer, **When** payment processing occurs, **Then** the system aggregates all deductions for that Sponsor for batch payment and generates an external report detailing the aggregated amounts.",
>   "9. **Given** a Non-Sponsor-based Wage Garnishment deduction is applied to a payment, **When** the claim payment is issued, **Then** the system generates a separate payment to the third-party creditor for the garnishment amount and reduces the insured's net payment accordingly.",
>   "10. **Given** a claims adjuster is reviewing FSA vs HSA options for a deduction, **When** comparing the two account types, **Then** the system enforces distinct rules: HSA requires HDHP eligibility, has higher contribution limits, allows year-to-year rollover and portability, can earn interest, and excludes self-employed individuals; FSA does not require HDHP, has lower limits, typically follows 'use it or lose it' rules, and is employer-only.",
>   "11. **Given** required deduction parameters are missing (type, amount/percentage, party information), **When** the user attempts to save the deduction, **Then** the system prevents saving and displays inline validation errors for all missing required fields.",
>   "12. **Given** a deduction is successfully created and applied to a payment, **When** the user views the payment details, **Then** the deduction line item, category (Sponsor vs Non-Sponsor), calculation method, and resulting net payment amount are all clearly displayed in the payment breakdown."

#### Feature: As a Claims Adjuster, I want to view payment allocations with detailed financial adjustments, so that I can verify payment calculations including gross amounts, deductions, taxes, and offsets.
- **Role**: Claims Adjuster
- **Action**: view payment allocations with detailed financial adjustments
- **Value**: I can verify payment calculations including gross amounts, deductions, taxes, and offsets

**Description:**

> **As a** Claims Adjuster,
> **I want to** view payment allocations with detailed financial adjustments,
> **so that** I can verify payment calculations including gross amounts, deductions, taxes, and offsets.


**Key Capabilities:**

> 1. System displays a paginated table of payment allocation transactions for a claim, showing 5 records per page with jump-to functionality.
> 2. Each payment allocation record presents comprehensive financial information including:
>    - Post Date, Transaction ID (payment number), and Type (from reserve type)
>    - Benefit period date range (From-Through Date)
>    - Financial breakdown: Offsets (sum of offset reductions), ADJ Gross (gross allocation amount), Deductions (sum of deductions), Taxes (sum of all taxes), Partial/CE (current earnings prorated amount), and Total (net allocation amount)
>    - Payment Status indicator displayed under the amount field
> 3. System calculates and displays summary totals:
>    - Total Payment as sum of all allocation net amounts
>    - Differentiation between positive amounts (payments) and negative amounts (recoveries)
> 4. Users can sort payment allocations by Post Date, Transaction ID, Type, From-Through Date, ADJ Gross, and Total columns, with sorting applied across all pages (not just current page).
> 5. Default display order is Post Date in descending order.
> 6. System provides Payment Additional Information section with detailed breakdown including Loss Type, Offset list, Deduction list, Taxes list, and Rehab (rehabilitation additions) list.
> 7. System applies conditional logic for Transaction ID and Payment Status display:
>    - 7.1 When payment date is after last generated payment date, Transaction ID displays the payment number value and Payment Status shows 'Pending'
>    - 7.2 When payment date is on or before last generated payment date, Transaction ID remains empty and Payment Status displays the actual payment state
>    - 7.3 When payment date is before last generated payment date, Payment Status displays the actual payment state
> 8. System provides refresh functionality with safeguards:
>    - 8.1 Refresh button is disabled during active refresh operations to prevent concurrent processing
>    - 8.2 Refresh button is hidden and unavailable after claim closure


**Acceptance Criteria:**

> 1. **Given** a claim with multiple payment allocations, **When** the Claims Adjuster navigates to the Payment Allocations List, **Then** the system displays all allocation transactions in a paginated table with 5 records per page, sorted by Post Date in descending order by default.
> 2. **Given** a payment allocation record, **When** displayed in the list, **Then** the system shows Post Date, Transaction ID, Type, benefit period (From-Through Date), and calculated financial breakdown (Offsets, ADJ Gross, Deductions, Taxes, Partial/CE, Total).
> 3. **Given** multiple payment allocation transactions, **When** the system calculates financial components, **Then**:
>    - Offsets equals sum of all reduction amounts where reductionType='OFFSET'
>    - Deductions equals sum of all reduction amounts where reductionType='DEDUCTION'
>    - Taxes equals sum of all tax amounts
>    - Total Payment equals sum of all allocation net amounts
> 4. **Given** a payment allocation, **When** the Total amount is calculated, **Then** positive values display as payments and negative values display as recoveries.
> 5. **Given** a payment with paymentDate > lastGeneratedPaymentDate, **When** displayed in the list, **Then** Transaction ID shows the payment number value and Payment Status displays 'Pending' under the amount field.
> 6. **Given** a payment with paymentDate &lt;= lastGeneratedPaymentDate, **When** displayed in the list, **Then** Transaction ID field remains empty and Payment Status displays the actual payment state.
> 7. **Given** the user clicks on a sortable column header (Post Date, Transaction ID, Type, From-Through Date, ADJ Gross, or Total), **When** sorting is applied, **Then** the system sorts all records across all pages, not just the current page.

#### Feature: As a Claims Adjuster, I want to manage offsets on disability claims with type, date range, amount, and prorating rate, so that I can apply statutory and manual offsets to reduce benefit payments.
- **Role**: Claims Adjuster
- **Action**: manage offsets on disability claims with type, date range, amount, and prorating rate
- **Value**: I can apply statutory and manual offsets to reduce benefit payments accurately and in compliance with policy terms

**Description:**

> **As a** Claims Adjuster,
> **I want to** manage offsets on disability claims with type, date range, amount, and prorating rate,
> **so that** I can apply statutory and manual offsets to reduce benefit payments accurately and in compliance with policy terms.


**Key Capabilities:**

> [
>   "1. Claims Adjuster accesses the Claim Overview Page to view and manage all offsets associated with the disability claim.",
>   "2. To create a new offset, the Claims Adjuster initiates the Add Offset process and provides required offset information:",
>   "   2.1. Selects the Type of Offset from predefined offset categories.",
>   "   2.2. Specifies the Beginning Date when the offset becomes effective.",
>   "   2.3. Specifies the Through Date when the offset ends (must be after Beginning Date).",
>   "   2.4. Enters the Offset Amount as a positive monetary value representing the reduction amount.",
>   "   2.5. Selects the Prorating Rate (1/5, 1/7, or 1/30) to determine how the offset is distributed across payment periods.",
>   "3. Upon saving the new offset, the system updates the Leave claim through backend integration and displays the offset entry in the Offsets section of the Claim Overview Page.",
>   "4. For existing manual offsets, the Claims Adjuster can modify offset details:",
>   "   4.1. Opens the Edit Offset form which pre-populates all current offset values.",
>   "   4.2. Updates any modifiable fields following the same validation rules as new offset creation.",
>   "   4.3. Saves changes to update the claim and refresh the Offsets display.",
>   "5. For existing manual offsets that are no longer applicable, the Claims Adjuster can remove the offset:",
>   "   5.1. Initiates the removal action for the selected offset entry.",
>   "   5.2. Confirms the removal decision through system prompt.",
>   "   5.3. System removes the offset and updates the claim financial calculations accordingly.",
>   "6. System distinguishes between manual and automatic offsets, restricting edit and remove operations to manual offsets only to preserve system-generated offset integrity.",
>   "7. At any point during offset form entry or editing, the Claims Adjuster can cancel the operation with confirmation to prevent accidental data loss."
> ]


**Acceptance Criteria:**

> [
>   "**Scenario 1: Successfully Add New Manual Offset**",
>   "1. Given the Claims Adjuster is on the Claim Overview Page with an active disability claim",
>   "   When the user clicks 'Add Offset' button",
>   "   Then the Add Offset slide-out form opens with all required fields empty and ready for input.",
>   "2. Given the Add Offset form is open",
>   "   When the user fills all required fields (Type of Offset, Beginning Date, Through Date, Offset Amount >0, Prorating Rate) with valid values and Through Date is after Beginning Date",
>   "   And clicks 'Save' button",
>   "   Then the system updates the Leave claim via REST>Update Loss, closes the form, and displays the new offset in the Offsets section on Claim Overview Page.",
>   "",
>   "**Scenario 2: Validation Prevents Invalid Offset Creation**",
>   "3. Given the Add Offset form is open",
>   "   When the user enters a Through Date that is earlier than or equal to Beginning Date",
>   "   Then the system displays a validation error and prevents form submission.",
>   "4. Given the Add Offset form is open",
>   "   When the user enters an Offset Amount of zero or negative value",
>   "   Then the system displays a validation error and prevents form submission.",
>   "5. Given the Add Offset form is open",
>   "   When the user attempts to save without filling any required field (Type of Offset, Beginning Date, Through Date, Offset Amount, or Prorating Rate)",
>   "   Then the system displays validation errors for all missing required fields and prevents form submission.",
>   "",
>   "**Scenario 3: Successfully Edit Existing Manual Offset**",
>   "6. Given a manual offset entry exists in the Offsets section",
>   "   When the Claims Adjuster clicks the 'Edit Icon' next to the manual offset entry",
>   "   Then the Edit Offset slide-out form opens with all current offset values pre-filled (Type of Offset, Beginning Date, Through Date, Offset Amount, Prorating Rate).",
>   "7. Given the Edit Offset form is open with pre-filled values",
>   "   When the user modifies one or more fields with valid values and clicks 'Save'",
>   "   Then the system updates the Leave claim via REST>Update Loss, closes the form, and displays the updated offset values in the Offsets section.",
>   "",
>   "**Scenario 4: System Protects Automatic Offsets from Manual Modification**",
>   "8. Given an automatic offset entry exists in the Offsets section",
>   "   When the Claims Adjuster views the offset entry",
>   "   Then the 'Edit Icon' and 'Remove Icon' are hidden and the offset cannot be manually modified or removed.",
>   "",
>   "**Scenario 5: Successfully Remove Manual Offset**",
>   "9. Given a manual offset entry exists in the Offsets section",
>   "   When the Claims Adjuster clicks the 'Remove Icon' next to the manual offset entry",
>   "   Then a confirmation modal displays with message 'Are you sure you want to remove this entry?' and Yes/No buttons.",
>   "10. Given the removal confirmation modal is displayed",
>   "    When the user clicks 'Yes'",
>   "    Then the system removes the offset entry, updates the claim, and refreshes the Claim Overview Page without the removed offset.",
>   "11. Given the removal confirmation modal is displayed",
>   "    When the user clicks 'No'",
>   "    Then the modal closes and the offset entry remains unchanged in the Offsets section.",
>   "",
>   "**Scenario 6: Cancel Offset Form Operations**",
>   "12. Given the Add Offset or Edit Offset form is open with data entered or modified",
>   "    When the user clicks 'Cancel' button or 'Close Icon'",
>   "    Then a confirmation modal displays with message 'Are you sure you want to close this form?' and Yes/No buttons.",
>   "13. Given the cancellation confirmation modal is displayed",
>   "    When the user clicks 'Yes'",

>   "    When the user clicks 'No'",
>   "    Then the modal closes and the user remains in the form to continue editing.",
>   "",
>   "**Scenario 7: Prorating Rate Selection**",
>   "15. Given the Add Offset or Edit Offset form is open",
>   "    When the user accesses the Prorating Rate dropdown",

>   "**Scenario 8: Data Mapping and Backend Integration**",
>   "16. Given the user successfully saves a new or edited offset",
>   "    When the system processes the save action",
>   "    Then all field values are correctly mapped to CapLeaveFinancialAdjustmentOffsetEntity: Type of Offset → offsetType (LU>OffsetType), Beginning Date → offsetTerm.effectiveDate, Through Date → offsetTerm.expirationDate, Offset Amount → offsetWeeklyAmount, Prorating Rate → offsetProratingRate (LU>ProratingRate), and the Leave claim is updated via REST>Update Loss API."

>   "- And no payment is transmitted to Payment Hub until rescheduling is resolved",
>   "",
>   "**Scenario 5: Payment Generation Filter Compliance**",
>   "- Given multiple payments in approved status with varying ASO Type values",
>   "- When Payment Issue Job executes",
>   "- Then only payments with ASO Type = ATP are retrieved and processed for issuance",

#### Feature: As a Claims Adjuster, I want to resolve payment method validation errors during payment dispatch, so that I can identify and correct payment method issues before issuance.
- **Role**: Claims Adjuster
- **Action**: resolve payment method validation errors during payment dispatch by identifying and correcting issues with payment methods (CHECK or EFT), customer/provider data, addresses, and effective dates
- **Value**: payments can be successfully issued without errors and delays caused by invalid payment methods, expired addresses, or inactive providers

**Description:**

> **As a** Claims Adjuster,
> **I want to** resolve payment method validation errors during payment dispatch by identifying and correcting issues with payment methods (CHECK or EFT), customer/provider data, addresses, and effective dates,
> **so that** payments can be successfully issued without errors and delays caused by invalid payment methods, expired addresses, or inactive providers.


**Key Capabilities:**

> 1. System loads current customer data from CEM when payment payee type is Policy Holder (IndividualCustomer) to ensure payment information is up-to-date.
> 2. System validates provider status is 'Active' when payment payee type is provider.
> 3. System resolves appropriate payment method by:
>    3.1 Using specific payment method ID if set and validating it is within effective/expiration date range (inclusive, both dates optional).
>    3.2 Filtering all customer payment methods by current date within effective/expiration dates when no specific method ID is set.
>    3.3 Filtering to include only CHECK and EFT payment method types.
>    3.4 Selecting preferred method (preferred=true) if available, otherwise selecting method with latest effective date.
> 4. System resolves payment method details based on payment type:
>    4.1 For EFT/ACH: Maps payment method token ID from payment method profile and sets entity type.
>    4.2 For CHECK: Resolves check mailing address by checking for specific address ID first, then filtering customer addresses by communication preference 'MailingAddressForCheck', and selecting preferred or most recent temporary address.
> 5. System generates payment hub dispatch request with mapped payment data including amount, currency, transaction date, recipient name, payment method type, and payment method details.
> 6. System generates validation messages with specific error codes and severity levels for encountered issues:
>    6.1 Customer/provider data loading failures.
>    6.2 Expired payment methods or addresses.
>    6.3 Missing payment methods or addresses.
>    6.4 Invalid payment method types (not CHECK or EFT).
>    6.5 Inactive provider state.
> 7. System sets validation status to 'Invalid' if any critical severity messages exist, otherwise sets status to 'Valid'.
> 8. Claims Adjuster reviews validation error messages to identify specific payment method issues preventing dispatch.
> 9. Claims Adjuster corrects identified issues by:
>    9.1 Updating expired payment methods with valid effective dates in CEM.
>    9.2 Adding or updating mailing addresses for check payments.
>    9.3 Changing payment method type from unsupported types (CASH, CREDIT_CARD) to supported types (CHECK, EFT).
>    9.4 Updating provider status to 'Active' or selecting alternate active provider.
>    9.5 Ensuring customer/payee data is properly loaded and accessible.
> 10. Claims Adjuster retriggers payment generation after corrections to validate successful dispatch request creation.


**Acceptance Criteria:**

> 1. **Given** a payment payee is an Individual Customer Policy Holder, **when** payment generation is initiated, **then** the system loads the latest customer data from CEM within 2 seconds.
> 2. **Given** a payment method ID is specified on the payment, **when** the system resolves payment method, **then** it validates the method is within effective/expiration date range (both dates inclusive and optional) and generates 'GenerateDispatchRequest-CAPPaymentMethodExpired' critical error if expired.
> 3. **Given** a payment method ID is specified but cannot be found, **when** the system resolves payment method, **then** it generates 'GenerateDispatchRequest-CAPPaymentMethodNotFound' critical error and sets validation status to 'Invalid'.
> 4. **Given** no payment method ID is specified, **when** the system resolves payment method, **then** it filters all customer payment methods by current date within effective dates and includes only CHECK and EFT types.
> 5. **Given** multiple valid payment methods exist, **when** the system selects payment method, **then** it selects the preferred method (preferred=true) if available, otherwise selects the method with latest effective date.
> 6. **Given** a payment method type is CASH or CREDIT_CARD, **when** validation occurs, **then** the system generates 'GetPreferredPaymentMethod-InvalidPaymentMethodType' critical error with message 'Invalid payment method type. Must be one of the values: [CHECK, EFT]'.
> 7. **Given** a CHECK payment method is selected, **when** the system resolves check address, **then** it first attempts to use the specified checkAddressId if set, otherwise filters addresses with communicationPreference='MailingAddressForCheck'.
> 8. **Given** a check address is found by ID but is expired, **when** validation occurs, **then** the system generates 'GenerateDispatchRequest-CAPCheckAddressExpired' critical error.
> 9. **Given** a check address cannot be found by specified ID, **when** validation occurs, **then** the system generates 'GenerateDispatchRequest-CAPCheckAddressNotFound' critical error.
> 10. **Given** no check addresses exist with communicationPreference='MailingAddressForCheck', **when** the system resolves check address, **then** it uses all filtered customer addresses excluding expired temporary addresses.
> 11. **Given** multiple applicable addresses exist for check payment, **when** the system selects address, **then** it selects preferred address if exists, otherwise temporary address with latest effective date, otherwise first applicable address.
> 12. **Given** a payment payee is a provider, **when** the system validates provider, **then** it verifies provider state is 'Active' and generates 'GenerateDispatchRequest-InvalidProviderState' critical error if not active.
> 13. **Given** a provider payee cannot be loaded, **when** validation occurs, **then** the system generates 'GenerateDispatchRequest-InvalidProvider' critical error with the provider URI.
> 14. **Given** customer data cannot be loaded for a payee, **when** validation occurs, **then** the system generates 'GetPreferredPaymentMethod-InvalidPayee' critical error with the payee URI.
> 15. **Given** any critical severity validation message exists, **when** validation status is determined, **then** the system sets validation status to 'Invalid' and blocks payment dispatch.
> 16. **Given** no critical severity validation messages exist, **when** validation status is determined, **then** the system sets validation status to 'Valid' and allows payment dispatch to proceed.
> 17. **Given** an Individual Customer recipient, **when** the system maps recipient name, **then** it concatenates customer first name and last name separated by space.
> 18. **Given** validation errors exist, **when** Claims Adjuster views payment validation results, **then** all validation messages display with error code, severity, and descriptive message within 1 second.

#### Feature: As a Claims Adjuster, I want to apply automatic offsets to disability claims based on configuration, so that statutory and manual offsets are correctly calculated and applied to benefit payments.
- **Role**: Claims Adjuster
- **Action**: apply automatic offsets to disability claims based on configuration
- **Value**: statutory and manual offsets are correctly calculated and applied to benefit payments

**Description:**

> **As a** Claims Adjuster,
> **I want to** apply automatic offsets to disability claims based on configuration,
> **so that** statutory and manual offsets are correctly calculated and applied to benefit payments.


**Key Capabilities:**

> 1. System retrieves applicable auto offset configuration for the disability claim based on priority order, claim type, and coverage code.
> 2. System identifies template allocations that qualify for offset application by filtering against the configuration's applicable claim types (e.g., STD, LTD) and loss type criteria.
>   2.1. If no applicable template allocations are found based on configuration filters, the system exits offset generation without creating any offsets.
> 3. System calculates auto offset weekly amounts for each claim payable period using the formula: (Payable Period Approved Gross Benefit Amount) / (Proration Rate) / (Calculated Payable Duration in weeks), with results rounded to two decimal places.
> 4. System generates auto-offset draft records for each overlapping period between payable periods and applicable allocations, capturing offset type, offset period, proration rate, weekly amount, priority, and associated offset claim.
> 5. System merges consecutive auto-offset drafts that share identical offset weekly amounts and offset claim references into consolidated drafts to optimize offset efficiency.
> 6. System processes drafts in priority order and generates final offset reductions by checking for existing offsets with the same type and overlapping periods.
>   6.1. When an existing offset fully overlaps with a draft period (full overlap scenario), the system does not generate any new offset for that draft.
>   6.2. When an existing offset partially overlaps with a draft period (partial overlap scenario), the system generates offsets only for the non-overlapping sub-periods within the draft period.
>   6.3. When no existing offset overlaps with a draft period (no overlap scenario), the system generates one offset with the offset period equal to the entire draft period.
> 7. System applies priority-based configuration rules spanning nine priority levels, including coverage-specific state offsets (NJTDB→STNJ, NYDBL→STNY, state paid medical/family leave programs), and claim-type offsets (STD→SHTM for LTD claims).
> 8. System adds all generated offset reductions to the payment template, making them available for payment calculation and distribution processes.


**Acceptance Criteria:**

> 1. **Given** a disability claim with coverage code NYDBL and claim type STD, **when** the auto offset rule executes, **then** the system retrieves configuration with priority 2 (STNY offset type) and applicable claim types STD and LTD.
> 2. **Given** a payment template with allocations for STD, NYDBL, and LTD claims, and the configuration specifies applicable claim types as 'STD, LTD', **when** filtering allocations, **then** the system identifies only the STD and LTD allocations as applicable, excluding NYDBL.
> 3. **Given** a configuration with applicable claim types specified, but no template allocations match those types, **when** the rule processes step 2, **then** the system exits immediately without executing steps 3-5 and generates zero offsets.
> 4. **Given** a payable period with AGBA of $300, proration rate of 1/5, and calculated payable duration of 15 weeks, **when** calculating auto offset weekly amount, **then** the system returns $100.00 (rounded to two decimals).
> 5. **Given** three consecutive auto-offset drafts with offset weekly amount $100 and offset claim LTD-12345, **when** the system performs draft merging in step 4, **then** the three drafts are consolidated into one draft covering the combined period.
> 6. **Given** an auto-offset draft for period 1-14 Jan and an existing manual offset of type STNY for period 5-10 Jan, **when** the system generates final offsets in step 5, **then** two auto offsets are created covering 1-4 Jan and 11-14 Jan (partial overlap scenario).
> 7. **Given** an auto-offset draft for period 1-14 Jan and an existing offset of type STNY covering the entire period 1-14 Jan, **when** the system checks for overlaps, **then** no new offset is generated (full overlap scenario).
> 8. **Given** an auto-offset draft for period 15-28 Jan and no existing offsets with the same type and overlapping period, **when** the system processes the draft, **then** one offset is created with offset period 15-28 Jan (no overlap scenario).
> 9. **Given** multiple auto-offset drafts with different priority values (priority 2 and priority 8), **when** the system sorts and processes drafts in step 5, **then** lower priority number drafts (priority 2) are processed before higher priority number drafts (priority 8).
> 10. **Given** a disability claim with coverage code NYTDB and claim type Any, **when** the auto offset rule executes, **then** the system applies priority 1 configuration with auto offset type STNJ for STD and LTD applicable claim types.
> 11. **Given** an LTD claim with coverage code Any and no specific state coverage, **when** the auto offset rule executes, **then** the system retrieves priority 9 configuration indicating 'No offset' and generates zero offsets.
> 12. **Given** an STD claim with coverage code Any, **when** processing template allocations, **then** the system applies priority 8 configuration with auto offset type SHTM to LTD applicable claim types only.
> 13. **Given** a claim with two payable periods (1-21 Jan with AGBA $300, 22-28 Jan with AGBA $100), both with proration rate 1/5, **when** calculating offset weekly amounts, **then** both periods yield $100 weekly offset amounts despite different AGBAs due to different payable durations.
> 14. **Given** all generated auto-offset reductions, **when** the rule completes execution, **then** all offsets are added to the payment template as reduction line items with accurate offset type, period, proration rate, and weekly amount attributes.
> 15. **Given** a payment template without any payable periods defined, **when** the auto offset rule executes, **then** the system generates zero offset drafts and exits gracefully without errors.

#### Feature: As a Claims Adjuster, I want to calculate AGBA (Adjusted Gross Benefit Amount) based on partial disability type and offsets, so that disability benefit amounts are correctly determined.
- **Role**: Claims Adjuster
- **Action**: calculate AGBA (Adjusted Gross Benefit Amount) based on partial disability type and offsets
- **Value**: disability benefit amounts are correctly determined

**Description:**

> **As a** Claims Adjuster,
> **I want to** calculate AGBA (Adjusted Gross Benefit Amount) based on partial disability type and offsets,
> **so that** disability benefit amounts are correctly determined.


**Key Capabilities:**

> 1. System evaluates claim parameters for each payable period to determine the appropriate AGBA calculation code using a hierarchical, first-match-wins decision logic.
> 2. System applies sequential condition checks in strict order:
>    2.1 Assigns Default Code when partial disability flag is false, partial disability type is 'NONE', or when disability earnings fall below the minimum partial earnings threshold (Prorated Disability Earnings Amount &lt; Prorated Pre-Disability Salary Amount × Minimum Partial Earnings Percentage).
&gt;    2.2 Assigns Zero Code when disability earnings exceed the maximum partial earnings threshold, with support for multi-year indexing scenarios (cumulative indexing percentages applied to pre-disability salary).
>    2.3 Assigns WIB Code when Work Incentive Benefit is marked as 'Included'.
>    2.4 Assigns Direct Offset Code when Partial Disability Type equals 'Direct Offset'.
>    2.5 Assigns Proportionate Loss Code when Partial Disability Type equals 'Proportionate Loss'.
>    2.6 Assigns Loss Of Earnings Code when Partial Disability Type equals 'Loss Of Earnings'.
>    2.7 Defaults to fallback code if no conditions are satisfied.
> 3. System executes the calculation formula corresponding to the selected code:
>    3.1 **Default formula**: AGBA = Prorated Gross Benefit Amount - Offsets.
>    3.2 **Zero formula**: AGBA = 0.
>    3.3 **WIB formula**: If (Prorated Gross Benefit Amount + Offsets + Prorated Disability Earnings Amount) ≤ Prorated Pre-Disability Salary Amount, then AGBA = Prorated Gross Benefit Amount; otherwise AGBA = Prorated Pre-Disability Salary Amount - Offsets - Prorated Disability Earnings Amount.
>    3.4 **Direct Offset formula**: Calculate Disability Offset = Prorated Disability Earnings Amount × Disability Earnings Reduced Percentage, round to two decimal places, then AGBA = Prorated Gross Benefit Amount - Offsets - Disability Offset.
>    3.5 **Proportionate Loss formula**: Calculate Loss Proportion = (Prorated Pre-Disability Salary Amount - Prorated Disability Earnings Amount) / Prorated Pre-Disability Salary Amount, then AGBA = (Prorated Gross Benefit Amount - Offsets) × Loss Proportion.
>    3.6 **Loss Of Earnings formula**: Calculate AGBA using both Direct Offset and Proportionate Loss methods, then select the greater of the two values.
> 4. System applies floor rule to ensure AGBA cannot be negative, setting AGBA = 0 if calculated value is less than zero.
> 5. System handles multi-year indexing scenarios:
>    5.1 For Year 1 or no indexing: applies Maximum Partial Earnings Percentage directly to Prorated Pre-Disability Salary Amount.
>    5.2 For Year 2 with indexing: applies compound calculation using Year 1 indexing percentage.
>    5.3 For Year n with indexing: applies cumulative sum of indexing percentages from Years 1 to n-1.
> 6. System applies product-specific override for GIP Product (UK-specific LTD with locale = en_GB), disabling AGBA calculations entirely.
> 7. System processes all AGBA calculations using prorated amounts, offsets, and earnings data captured during the claim assessment and ongoing review process.


**Acceptance Criteria:**

> 1. **Given** a claim with Is Partial Disability = FALSE, **when** AGBA calculation is triggered, **then** the system assigns Default Code and calculates AGBA = Prorated Gross Benefit Amount - Offsets.
> 2. **Given** a claim with Prorated Disability Earnings Amount &lt; (Prorated Pre-Disability Salary Amount × Minimum Partial Earnings Percentage), **when** the minimum threshold is configured, **then** the system assigns Default Code and provides full non-partial benefit.
&gt; 3. **Given** a claim with Prorated Disability Earnings Amount > (Prorated Pre-Disability Salary Amount × Maximum Partial Earnings Percentage) in Year 1, **when** no indexing is applied, **then** the system assigns Zero Code and sets AGBA = 0.
> 4. **Given** a claim in Year 2 with Indexing of Monthly Earnings = Yes, **when** Prorated Disability Earnings Amount exceeds indexed threshold (Prorated Pre-Disability Salary Amount × (1 + Indexing % Year 1) × Maximum Partial Earnings Percentage), **then** the system assigns Zero Code and sets AGBA = 0.
> 5. **Given** a claim with Work Incentive Benefit = 'Included', **when** (Prorated Gross Benefit Amount + Offsets + Prorated Disability Earnings Amount) ≤ Prorated Pre-Disability Salary Amount, **then** AGBA equals Prorated Gross Benefit Amount (full benefit preserved).
> 6. **Given** a claim with Work Incentive Benefit = 'Included', **when** (Prorated Gross Benefit Amount + Offsets + Prorated Disability Earnings Amount) > Prorated Pre-Disability Salary Amount, **then** AGBA = Prorated Pre-Disability Salary Amount - Offsets - Prorated Disability Earnings Amount.
> 7. **Given** a claim with Partial Disability Type = 'Direct Offset', **when** AGBA is calculated, **then** the system computes Disability Offset = Prorated Disability Earnings Amount × Disability Earnings Reduced Percentage, rounds to two decimal places, and calculates AGBA = Prorated Gross Benefit Amount - Offsets - Disability Offset.
> 8. **Given** a claim with Partial Disability Type = 'Proportionate Loss', **when** AGBA is calculated, **then** the system computes Loss Proportion = (Prorated Pre-Disability Salary Amount - Prorated Disability Earnings Amount) / Prorated Pre-Disability Salary Amount, and AGBA = (Prorated Gross Benefit Amount - Offsets) × Loss Proportion.
> 9. **Given** a claim with Partial Disability Type = 'Loss Of Earnings', **when** AGBA is calculated, **then** the system calculates AGBA using both Direct Offset and Proportionate Loss formulas and selects the greater value.
> 10. **Given** any calculation code, **when** the calculated AGBA value is negative, **then** the system applies the floor rule and sets AGBA = 0.
> 11. **Given** a GIP Product claim with locale = en_GB, **when** AGBA calculation is triggered, **then** the system bypasses all AGBA calculations entirely (product-specific override).
> 12. **Given** a claim in Year n with indexing enabled, **when** evaluating Maximum Partial Earnings threshold, **then** the system applies cumulative indexing percentages: Prorated Pre-Disability Salary Amount × (1 + Sum of Indexing % Years 1 to n-1).
> 13. **Given** multiple conditions that could match, **when** AGBA calculation code is determined, **then** the system selects the first matching condition in hierarchical order (Default > Zero > WIB > Direct Offset > Proportionate Loss > Loss Of Earnings).
> 14. **Given** a claim missing required data elements (e.g., Prorated Gross Benefit Amount, Prorated Disability Earnings Amount, or Prorated Pre-Disability Salary Amount), **when** AGBA calculation is triggered, **then** the system produces an error or validation failure preventing calculation.
> 15. **Given** a claim with WIB included but WIB duration is missing, **when** AGBA calculation is triggered, **then** the system behavior is undefined (OPEN QUESTION - requires clarification on error handling, default duration, or unlimited duration treatment).

#### Feature: As a Claims Adjuster, I want to handle ASO (Administrative Services Only) claims with ATP and ATP with Check payment types, so that I can process self-funded group claims correctly.
- **Role**: Claims Adjuster
- **Action**: handle ASO (Administrative Services Only) claims with ATP and ATP with Check payment types
- **Value**: I can process self-funded group claims correctly according to the service arrangement and funding method

**Description:**

> **As a** Claims Adjuster,
> **I want to** handle ASO (Administrative Services Only) claims with ATP and ATP with Check payment types,
> **so that** I can process self-funded group claims correctly according to the service arrangement and funding method.


**Key Capabilities:**

> 1. System identifies claims with ASO indicator and displays special handling type (ATP or ATP with Check) on Claim Overview header to alert the adjuster of the service arrangement.
> 2. User creates payment records for ASO claims, with the system automatically tagging payment items with the appropriate ASO type indicator throughout the UI.
> 3. User updates payment information as needed during claim adjudication process.
> 4. System processes payments according to ASO type:
>    4.1. **ATP (Advice to Pay) Flow**: When ASO Type is ATP, the carrier calculates payment amount but does NOT issue payment to claimant.
>       4.1.1. User can create and update payment normally through standard workflow.
>       4.1.2. When payment status reaches 'Approved', system automatically hides 'Request Issue' action from UI to prevent payment issuance.
>       4.1.3. System calculates payment amount but does NOT send payment request to payment hub.
>       4.1.4. Employer receives payment determination information and manages actual payment to claimant directly.
>    4.2. **ATP with Check Flow**: When ASO Type is ATP with Check, carrier provides full claim management including payment issuance.
>       4.2.1. User can create, update, and issue payment through complete payment lifecycle.
>       4.2.2. System sends payment request to payment hub with ASO type indicator 'ATP with Check'.
>       4.2.3. **For Direct Billing funding method**: Payment hub issues payment from carrier funds; system integrates with Employer Management Portal to send notification task to employer; carrier receives reimbursement from employer after payment.
>       4.2.4. **For Alternative Account funding method**: Payment is drawn directly from employer-funded bank account; system sends ASO type indicator to payment hub for proper account handling.
> 5. System manages special handling restrictions:
>    5.1. ASO special handling indicator cannot be manually removed from UI once set on a claim.
>    5.2. For unsupported products (Life, Critical Illness, Hospital Indemnity, Health Insurance, Accident), special handling values can be set manually in UI, but ASO claim payment processing functionality is NOT supported due to unpredictable claims and higher severity making ASO arrangements uncommon.
> 6. System displays ASO Type tags on payment records in Payment List UI and throughout payment workflow to distinguish ATP from ATP with Check payments for operational clarity.


**Acceptance Criteria:**

> 1. **Given** a claim is designated as ASO, **when** the Claims Adjuster views the Claim Overview screen, **then** the system displays the special handling indicator (ATP or ATP with Check) in the claim header.
> 2. **Given** an ASO claim exists, **when** the adjuster creates a payment record, **then** the system automatically tags the payment item with the corresponding ASO type (ATP or ATP with Check) visible throughout the payment UI.
> 3. **Given** a payment for an ASO claim with ATP type, **when** the payment status reaches 'Approved', **then** the system hides the 'Request Issue' action from the UI and does NOT send the payment to the payment hub.
> 4. **Given** a payment for an ASO claim with ATP type is approved, **when** the system processes the payment, **then** the payment amount is calculated and recorded, but no actual payment issuance occurs, and the employer is provided with payment determination information.
> 5. **Given** a payment for an ASO claim with ATP with Check type, **when** the adjuster requests payment issuance, **then** the system sends the payment request to the payment hub with the ASO type indicator 'ATP with Check'.
> 6. **Given** an ATP with Check payment with Direct Billing funding method, **when** the payment is issued, **then**:
>    6.1. The payment hub issues payment from carrier funds.
>    6.2. The system sends a notification task to the employer via the Employer Management Portal.
>    6.3. The system tracks the reimbursement due from employer to carrier.
> 7. **Given** an ATP with Check payment with Alternative Account funding method, **when** the payment is issued, **then** the payment is drawn directly from the employer-funded bank account with ASO type indicator sent to payment hub.
> 8. **Given** an ASO special handling is set on a claim, **when** the adjuster attempts to remove it via UI, **then** the system prevents removal of the special handling indicator.
> 9. **Given** a claim for an unsupported product (Life, Critical Illness, Hospital Indemnity, Health Insurance, or Accident), **when** the adjuster manually sets ATP or ATP with Check special handling values, **then** the values are stored but ASO payment processing functionality does NOT execute.
> 10. **Given** multiple ASO payments exist, **when** the adjuster views the Payment List UI, **then** the system displays ASO type tags on each payment record to clearly distinguish between ATP and ATP with Check payment types.
> 11. **Given** supported products (Disability, Leave, Dental, Vision), **when** ASO claims are processed, **then** full ASO payment functionality is available and executes correctly according to the ASO type.
> 12. **Given** an ATP payment is in any pre-approved status, **when** the adjuster updates payment information, **then** the system allows normal payment updates without restriction.
> 13. **Given** integration with payment hub, **when** an ATP with Check payment is sent, **then** the payment hub receives the ASO type indicator and processes payment according to the specified funding method within expected service level agreements.

#### Feature: As a Claims Adjuster, I want to manage tax withholdings with type, amount, date range, and claim selection, so that I can ensure correct tax deductions from disability claim payments.
- **Role**: Claims Adjuster
- **Action**: manage tax withholdings with type, amount, date range, and claim selection
- **Value**: I can ensure correct tax deductions from disability claim payments

**Description:**

> **As a** Claims Adjuster,
> **I want to** manage tax withholdings with type, amount, date range, and claim selection,
> **so that** I can ensure correct tax deductions from disability claim payments.


**Key Capabilities:**

> 1. User accesses the Withholdings management interface for an existing event case containing at least one disability claim (STD/SMD or LTD).
> 2. **Add New Withholding**: User creates a new tax withholding entry by:
>    2.1. Selecting the applicable tax type from available options.
>    2.2. Specifying the withholding amount using either a flat dollar amount or a percentage-based calculation.
>       2.2.1. When using percentage-based withholding, user may optionally specify an extra withholding amount.
>    2.3. Defining the effective date range by entering 'From' and 'Through' dates.
>    2.4. Selecting the specific disability claim to which the withholding applies from available claims.
>       2.4.1. If operating at payment level, the claim is automatically preselected and cannot be modified.
>    2.5. Submitting the withholding entry for validation and storage.
> 3. **Edit Existing Withholding**: User modifies previously configured withholding entries by:
>    3.1. Selecting the withholding entry to edit.
>    3.2. Updating any of the previously entered fields (tax type, amount, dates, claim association).
>    3.3. Saving the changes, which are subject to the same validation rules as new entries.
> 4. **Remove Withholding**: User deletes withholding entries that are no longer applicable by:
>    4.1. Initiating the removal action for a selected withholding entry.
>    4.2. Confirming the removal through a system prompt.
>       4.2.1. If removal is not confirmed, the action is cancelled without changes.
>    4.3. The system removes the entry and updates the withholdings list.
> 5. **Validation and Persistence**: Upon submission of add or edit actions, the system validates all business rules and saves the withholding configuration, making it immediately effective for payment processing.
> 6. All withholding entries are displayed in the Withholdings interface, providing a complete view of tax deductions configured for the case.


**Acceptance Criteria:**

> 1. **Given** a Claims Adjuster with 'CAP>Case: Update Taxes Details (Withholdings and YTD Earnings)' privilege accesses an event case with at least one disability claim,
>    **When** they initiate the Add Withholding action,
>    **Then** the system displays the Add Withholding form with all required fields (Tax Type, Tax Amount, Withholding From date, Withholding Through date, Claim selection).
>
> 2. **Given** the Add Withholding form is open,
>    **When** the user enters a flat dollar Tax Amount,
>    **Then** the system allows selection of only one disability claim from the dropdown containing STD/SMD/LTD claims.
>
> 3. **Given** the Add Withholding form is open,
>    **When** the user selects percentage-based Tax Amount entry,
>    **Then** the system displays an optional 'Extra Withholding' field for additional flat amount entry.
>
> 4. **Given** the user enters percentage-based Tax Amount with an Extra Withholding value greater than 0,
>    **When** they attempt to select multiple claims,
>    **Then** the system restricts selection to only one claim.
>
> 5. **Given** the user is operating at payment level (claim-specific context),
>    **When** the Add Withholding form is displayed,
>    **Then** the claim field is preselected with the current claim and is non-editable.
>
> 6. **Given** the user completes all required fields correctly,
>    **When** they submit the withholding entry,
>    **Then** the system validates the data, saves the withholding record, and displays it in the Withholdings UI within 2 seconds.
>
> 7. **Given** the user submits a withholding entry with missing mandatory fields (Type, Period, Amount, or Claim),
>    **When** validation occurs,
>    **Then** the system returns inline error messages identifying the missing fields and prevents submission.
>
> 8. **Given** the user enters both flat dollar Amount AND percentage Amount simultaneously,
>    **When** validation occurs,
>    **Then** the system returns an error message indicating these fields are mutually exclusive and prevents submission.
>
> 9. **Given** an existing withholding entry is displayed,
>    **When** the user clicks the edit icon,
>    **Then** the system opens the edit form with all previously entered values pre-populated.
>
> 10. **Given** the user modifies fields in the edit form and saves changes,
>     **When** validation passes,
>     **Then** the system updates the withholding record and reflects the changes immediately in the Withholdings UI.
>
> 11. **Given** an existing withholding entry is displayed,
>     **When** the user clicks the Remove icon and confirms the removal,
>     **Then** the system deletes the withholding record and updates the list to exclude the removed entry.
>
> 12. **Given** the user initiates withholding removal,
>     **When** the confirmation prompt is displayed and the user cancels the action,
>     **Then** the system closes the prompt without making any changes and the withholding remains in the list.
>
> 13. **Given** the user enters date values using the calendar widget or manual entry,
>     **When** both 'From' and 'Through' dates are provided,
>     **Then** the system accepts the date range if 'Through' date is equal to or after 'From' date.
>
> 14. **Given** multiple withholding entries exist for a case,
>     **When** the user views the Withholdings UI,
>     **Then** the system displays all configured withholdings with complete details (type, amount, date range, associated claim).
>
> 15. **Given** the user attempts to save a withholding with validation errors,
>     **When** the error messages are displayed,
>     **Then** the user can correct the errors and resubmit without losing other entered data.

## Initiative: Claims Adjustment & Recalculation

### Epic: Financial Adjustments & Settlement Management

#### Feature: As a Claims Adjuster, I want to add and edit prior earnings for state-mandated disability claims, so that I can accurately calculate covered weekly earnings and trigger claim recalculation.
- **Role**: Claims Adjuster
- **Action**: add, edit, and remove prior earnings records for state-mandated disability claims (NYDBL, NJTDB, MAPML)
- **Value**: covered weekly earnings and gross benefit amounts are accurately calculated and the claim is properly re-adjudicated to ensure correct settlement values

**Description:**

> **As a** Claims Adjuster,

> **so that** covered weekly earnings and gross benefit amounts are accurately calculated and the claim is properly re-adjudicated to ensure correct settlement values.


**Key Capabilities:**

> 1. Adjuster accesses the Prior Earnings UI on the SMP claim overview page to manage earnings records.
> 2. For adding new prior earnings:
>   2.1 Adjuster initiates the Add Earnings form and provides earnings details including week/quarter number, ending date, days/weeks worked, and gross amount paid.
>   2.2 System validates the entered data and creates the new prior earnings record.
>   2.3 System automatically triggers claim re-adjudication and recalculates Covered Weekly Earnings and GBA values.
>   2.4 System refreshes the display to show the new record and updated calculated values in the Earnings and Coverages sections.
> 3. For editing existing prior earnings:
>   3.1 Adjuster selects an existing prior earnings record for modification.
>   3.2 System displays the record in edit mode with pre-populated field values.
>   3.3 Adjuster updates the necessary fields and saves the changes.
>   3.4 System validates the updates, triggers claim re-adjudication, and recalculates settlement values.
>   3.5 System refreshes the display to reflect the updated record and recalculated earnings values.
> 4. For removing prior earnings:
>   4.1 Adjuster initiates removal of an existing prior earnings record.
>   4.2 System prompts for confirmation to prevent accidental deletion.
>   4.3 Upon confirmation, system removes the record, triggers claim re-adjudication, and recalculates settlement values.
>   4.4 System updates the display to show the revised earnings list and recalculated values.
> 5. System displays prior earnings in the format appropriate to the coverage type: by weeks for NYDBL and NJTDB claims, or by quarters for MAPML claims.
> 6. All earnings modifications immediately impact downstream financial calculations and are reflected in both the Earnings section (Covered Weekly Earnings) and Coverages section (GBA).


**Acceptance Criteria:**

> 1. **Given** a Claims Adjuster with PRIV>CAP>Update Loss privilege accessing an SMP claim, **When** the adjuster adds a new prior earnings record with valid week/quarter number, ending date, days/weeks worked, and gross amount paid, **Then** the system creates the record, triggers claim re-adjudication, recalculates Covered Weekly Earnings and GBA, and displays the updated values within the Earnings and Coverages sections.
> 2. **Given** an SMP claim with NYDBL or NJTDB coverage, **When** the adjuster views the Prior Earnings UI, **Then** the system displays prior earnings records organized by weeks.
> 3. **Given** an SMP claim with MAPML coverage, **When** the adjuster views the Prior Earnings UI, **Then** the system displays prior earnings records organized by quarters.
> 4. **Given** an existing prior earnings record on an SMP claim, **When** the adjuster clicks the edit icon and modifies any field values, **Then** the system validates the changes, updates the record, triggers claim re-adjudication, recalculates Covered Weekly Earnings and GBA, and displays the updated values.
> 5. **Given** an existing prior earnings record on an SMP claim, **When** the adjuster initiates removal and confirms the deletion, **Then** the system removes the record, triggers claim re-adjudication, recalculates Covered Weekly Earnings and GBA based on remaining records, and refreshes the display.
> 6. **Given** an adjuster attempting to remove a prior earnings record, **When** the removal is initiated, **Then** the system displays a confirmation dialog requiring explicit approval before proceeding with the deletion.
> 7. **Given** an adjuster without PRIV>CAP>Update Loss privilege, **When** the adjuster attempts to add, edit, or remove prior earnings, **Then** the system prevents the operation and displays appropriate authorization error.
> 8. **Given** multiple prior earnings records exist on a claim, **When** any record is added, edited, or removed, **Then** the system recalculates the total Covered Weekly Earnings and GBA values based on all remaining records and applicable business rules.
> 9. **Given** an adjuster is editing a prior earnings record, **When** the adjuster cancels the operation before saving, **Then** the system discards the changes and returns the record to its original state without triggering recalculation.
> 10. **Given** invalid or incomplete data is entered in the prior earnings form, **When** the adjuster attempts to save, **Then** the system displays validation errors and prevents the record from being saved until corrections are made.

#### Feature: As a Claims Examiner, I want to refresh policy data on a claim to reflect policy changes, so that claim eligibility, benefits, and payment calculations are updated automatically.
- **Role**: Claims Examiner
- **Action**: refresh policy data on a claim to reflect policy changes
- **Value**: claim eligibility, benefits, and payment calculations are updated automatically

**Description:**

> **As a** Claims Examiner,
> **I want to** refresh policy data on a claim to reflect policy changes,
> **so that** claim eligibility, benefits, and payment calculations are updated automatically.


**Key Capabilities:**

> 1. Claims Examiner initiates policy refresh action from the Claim Overview page for claims with 'Pending' or 'Open' status.
> 2. System validates the Date of Loss (DOL) and checks for the existence of a new policy version applicable to the claim.
>    2.1. If no new policy version is found, system displays informational message and ends the process without updates.
> 3. When a new policy version is identified, system presents a confirmation modal displaying the new policy version number and provides a link to view detailed policy changes via Policy History comparison.
> 4. Claims Examiner reviews policy changes and decides whether to proceed.
>    4.1. If examiner cancels the action, policy refresh workflow is not triggered and process ends without updates.
> 5. Upon confirmation, system triggers policy refresh workflow and re-integrates current policy data with the claim.
> 6. System performs comprehensive recalculation cascade including: re-running eligibility rules based on updated waiting periods and incurral periods, updating accumulators based on new benefit maximums and time periods, recalculating Gross Benefit Amount (GBA) using updated benefit schedules and face values.
>    6.1. If coverage no longer exists under the new policy terms, system sets coverage status to non-eligible instead of recalculating benefits.
> 7. System reschedules payment obligations based on updated benefit amounts and generates balance adjustments where applicable.
> 8. System preserves any manually overridden values on the claim, ensuring examiner adjustments are not automatically replaced by policy data.


**Acceptance Criteria:**

> 1. **Given** a claim with status 'Pending' or 'Open' and user has PRIV>CAP>Claim UI: Policy Refresh privilege, **when** the Claims Examiner navigates to Claim Overview page, **then** the Policy Refresh button is displayed and enabled.
> 2. **Given** the Claims Examiner clicks Policy Refresh button, **when** system checks for new policy version based on Date of Loss, **then** the check completes within 3 seconds.
> 3. **Given** a new policy version exists for the Date of Loss, **when** system displays confirmation modal, **then** the modal shows the new policy version number, a link to compare policy transactions (latest vs. previous version), and 'Yes' and 'Cancel' action buttons.
> 4. **Given** no new policy version exists for the Date of Loss, **when** system completes the check, **then** a modal displays the message 'No new policy version is found' with a Cancel button, and no claim updates are performed.
> 5. **Given** the confirmation modal is displayed, **when** the Claims Examiner clicks 'Cancel', **then** the policy refresh workflow is not triggered, the modal closes, and the claim data remains unchanged.
> 6. **Given** the Claims Examiner clicks 'Yes' in the confirmation modal, **when** system triggers policy refresh workflow, **then** system re-integrates with the new policy version and initiates claim recalculation.
> 7. **Given** policy data has been refreshed, **when** eligibility rules are re-evaluated, **then** system updates eligibility results based on new waiting periods, incurral periods, and time period configurations.
> 8. **Given** eligibility rules have been re-evaluated, **when** coverage still exists under the new policy, **then** system updates accumulators, recalculates GBA using new benefit schedules, benefit amounts, and reduction schedules, and generates updated Face Value.
> 9. **Given** eligibility rules have been re-evaluated, **when** coverage no longer exists under the new policy, **then** system sets the coverage status to non-eligible and does not recalculate GBA.
> 10. **Given** GBA has been recalculated, **when** payment rescheduling is triggered, **then** system adjusts payment schedules and generates balance entries if payment amounts have changed.
> 11. **Given** the claim contains manually overridden values (e.g., benefit amounts, eligibility dates), **when** policy refresh is executed, **then** all overridden values remain unchanged and are not replaced by policy data.
> 12. **Given** policy changes include modifications to Benefit Schedule (adding or removing benefits), **when** recalculation occurs, **then** system validates existing settlement against new benefits and updates GBA accordingly.
> 13. **Given** policy changes include modifications to Beneficiary information, **when** recalculation occurs, **then** system recalculates payment amount distribution based on updated beneficiary rules.
> 14. **Given** policy changes affect multiple policy-sensitive fields (e.g., Benefit Maximum, Time Period, Benefit Amount) for Accident, Critical Illness, or Hospital Indemnity lines of business, **when** recalculation occurs, **then** system updates accumulators and GBA reflecting all applicable changes.
> 15. **Given** policy changes include First Day Hospitalization modifications for Disability Income line of business, **when** recalculation occurs, **then** system recalculates Through Date based on updated hospitalization rules.
> 16. **Given** the user does not have PRIV>CAP>Claim UI: Policy Refresh privilege, **when** the user navigates to Claim Overview page, **then** the Policy Refresh button is not displayed.
> 17. **Given** the claim status is neither 'Pending' nor 'Open', **when** the user navigates to Claim Overview page, **then** the Policy Refresh button is disabled or not available.

#### Feature: As a Claims Adjuster, I want to cancel coverage and undo cancellation with proper accumulator management, so that I can reverse coverage decisions and regenerate payments or overpayment balances as needed.
- **Role**: Claims Adjuster
- **Action**: cancel coverage and undo cancellation with proper accumulator management
- **Value**: I can reverse coverage decisions and regenerate payments or overpayment balances as needed

**Description:**

> **As a** Claims Adjuster,
> **I want to** cancel coverage and undo cancellation with proper accumulator management,
> **so that** I can reverse coverage decisions and regenerate payments or overpayment balances as needed.


**Key Capabilities:**

> [
>   "1. Cancel Coverage operation enables the adjuster to mark coverage as cancelled with mandatory cancellation reason documentation.",
>   "2. Upon cancellation, the system manages accumulators based on payment status:",
>   "   2.1. If settlement is approved but payment is NOT made: Individual and Group Accumulator Reserved Amounts are released (set to $0, Remaining limit increases back).",
>   "   2.2. If payment has been issued: Overpayment Balance is generated equal to the payment amount; Individual and Group Accumulator Used Amounts remain unchanged.",
>   "3. The system executes accumulator clearing to unreserve Reserved Amount back to remaining limit based on settlement and payment allocation status.",
>   "4. For coverage with approved payment records, the system triggers payment rescheduling and hides payment records from UI while retaining them in backend Payment Schedule.",
>   "5. Cancelled coverage is locked and excluded from policy, case, or claim update propagation, re-adjudication/refresh processes, and payment reschedule processes until explicitly restored.",
>   "6. Undo Cancellation operation allows the adjuster to restore cancelled coverage by resetting cancellation indicators and clearing cancellation reason.",
>   "7. Upon undo cancellation, the system restores accumulators based on payment status:",
>   "   7.1. If payment was NOT made: Individual and Group Accumulator Reserved Amounts are restored (Remaining limit decreases).",
>   "   7.2. If payment was approved but NOT issued: Payment must be manually recreated if needed; Individual and Group Accumulator Reserved Amounts are restored.",
>   "   7.3. If payment was issued: Payment remains unchanged; previously generated Overpayment Balance is cleared (Balance=$0); Individual and Group Accumulator Used Amounts remain unchanged.",
>   "8. The system re-adjudicates the settlement to re-run eligibility rules, gross amount calculation, and accumulator limit calculations.",
>   "   8.1. If Override checkbox is checked: System displays overridden eligibility status and overridden Gross Amount instead of re-calculated values.",
>   "9. The system reserves the Gross Amount in the accumulator for restored settlements based on payment allocation status.",
>   "10. The system triggers payment rescheduling and balance adjustment:",
>   "    10.1. For coverage with approved payment records: Calls payment rescheduling and shows previously hidden payment records on UI.",
>   "    10.2. For coverage with issued/failed payment records: Calls recalculation process and removes previously generated overpayment balance amount."
> ]


**Acceptance Criteria:**

> [
>   "1. **Given** a settlement is approved but payment is NOT made, **when** the adjuster cancels the coverage with a mandatory cancellation reason, **then** the system sets isCancelled=True, releases Individual and Group Accumulator Reserved Amounts to $0, increases Remaining limits, and locks the coverage from re-adjudication.",
>   "2. **Given** a payment has been issued for the coverage, **when** the adjuster cancels the coverage, **then** the system generates an Overpayment Balance equal to the payment amount and maintains unchanged Individual and Group Accumulator Used Amounts.",
>   "3. **Given** coverage has approved payment records, **when** cancellation is executed, **then** the system calls payment rescheduling process, finds payment allocations where payment status=Approved AND associated settlement's isCancelled=True, and hides these payment records from UI while retaining them in backend Payment Schedule.",
>   "4. **Given** coverage is cancelled, **when** policy, case, or claim updates occur, **then** the cancelled coverage is excluded from update propagation, re-adjudication/refresh processes, and payment reschedule processes.",
>   "5. **Given** a cancelled coverage exists, **when** the adjuster performs Undo Cancellation, **then** the system sets isCancelled=False, clears the cancelReason, and makes cancelReason NOT mandatory.",
>   "6. **Given** payment was NOT made on cancelled coverage, **when** undo cancellation is executed, **then** the system restores Individual and Group Accumulator Reserved Amounts and decreases Remaining limits accordingly.",
>   "7. **Given** payment was issued on cancelled coverage, **when** undo cancellation is executed, **then** the system clears the Overpayment Balance to $0, leaves the issued payment unchanged, and maintains unchanged Individual and Group Accumulator Used Amounts.",
>   "8. **Given** undo cancellation is performed without Override checkbox checked, **when** the system re-adjudicates the settlement, **then** eligibility rules, gross amount calculation, and accumulator limit calculations are re-run and updated values are displayed.",
>   "9. **Given** undo cancellation is performed with Override checkbox checked, **when** the system re-adjudicates the settlement, **then** the system displays the overridden eligibility status and overridden Gross Amount instead of re-calculated values.",
>   "10. **Given** coverage with approved payment records is restored, **when** undo cancellation completes, **then** the system calls payment rescheduling process and shows previously hidden payment records on the UI.",
>   "11. **Given** coverage with issued or failed payment records is restored, **when** undo cancellation completes, **then** the system calls recalculation process and removes the previously generated overpayment balance amount.",
>   "12. **Given** no applicable payment allocations are found during cancellation or undo cancellation, **when** payment processing steps are triggered, **then** the system skips payment rescheduling and balance adjustment steps.",
>   "13. **Given** payment was approved but NOT issued on cancelled coverage, **when** undo cancellation is executed, **then** the payment is not automatically recreated and must be manually recreated if needed, while Individual and Group Accumulator Reserved Amounts are restored."

#### Feature: As a Claims Adjuster, I want to edit claim coverage data (earnings, GBA, taxable percentage) with override capability, so that I can adjust settlement calculations and trigger re-adjudication.
- **Role**: Claims Adjuster
- **Action**: edit claim coverage data (earnings, GBA, taxable percentage) with override capability
- **Value**: I can adjust settlement calculations and trigger re-adjudication to ensure accurate benefit payments

**Description:**

> **As a** Claims Adjuster,
> **I want to** edit claim coverage data (earnings, GBA, taxable percentage) with override capability,
> **so that** I can adjust settlement calculations and trigger re-adjudication to ensure accurate benefit payments reflect policy terms and claimant circumstances.


**Key Capabilities:**

> 1. Adjuster initiates editing mode for STD Claim coverage data from the Coverage UI section across common elements, taxable percentage, or coverage data subsections.
> 2. System presents coverage fields in context-aware states:
>    2.1 For first-time edits: all fields display in read-only mode pre-populated with settlement result values, with Override checkboxes available for overridable fields.
>    2.2 For subsequent edits: previously overridden fields appear activated with Override checkboxes marked, non-overridden fields remain read-only, and available-for-override fields display unmarked Override checkboxes.
> 3. Adjuster selects specific fields to override by marking corresponding Override checkboxes, which activates those fields for data entry.
> 4. Adjuster enters or modifies values in activated fields according to business requirements.
> 5. Adjuster can revert previously overridden values at any time:
>    5.1 Unmarking the Override checkbox disables editing for that field.
>    5.2 System clears the override value and restores the original settlement result value.
> 6. Upon saving, system validates overridden data against business rules:
>    6.1 If validation succeeds: system initiates automatic re-adjudication via REST>Readjudicate Settlement API.
>    6.2 If validation fails: system displays error messages and allows adjuster to correct data or revert overrides.
> 7. System completes re-adjudication and displays updated and recalculated coverage data in preview mode without requiring manual page refresh.
> 8. All override actions and re-adjudication results are persisted to the claim settlement record.


**Acceptance Criteria:**

> 1. **Given** an adjuster with PRIV>CAP>Adjudicate Settlement privilege and an STD Claim in Pending, Approved, or Disapproved state,
>    **When** the adjuster clicks the Edit icon in any Coverage section,
>    **Then** the system activates editing mode with all fields in read-only state and Override checkboxes displayed for overridable fields.
>
> 2. **Given** editing mode is active for the first time,
>    **When** the adjuster marks an Override checkbox,
>    **Then** the corresponding field becomes editable and accepts user input.
>
> 3. **Given** the adjuster has previously overridden one or more fields,
>    **When** the adjuster re-enters editing mode,
>    **Then** previously overridden fields display as editable with Override checkboxes marked, and non-overridden fields remain read-only.
>
> 4. **Given** an Override checkbox is marked and a field contains an override value,
>    **When** the adjuster unmarks the Override checkbox,
>    **Then** the field becomes read-only, the override value is cleared, and the original settlement result value is restored.
>
> 5. **Given** the adjuster has entered valid override values,
>    **When** the adjuster saves the data,
>    **Then** the system validates the data, initiates re-adjudication via REST>Readjudicate Settlement, and displays recalculated coverage data without manual refresh within 5 seconds.
>
> 6. **Given** the adjuster has entered override values that violate business rules,
>    **When** the adjuster attempts to save,
>    **Then** the system displays specific error messages and prevents re-adjudication until the data is corrected or overrides are reverted.
>
> 7. **Given** re-adjudication has completed successfully,
>    **When** the Coverage UI section refreshes,
>    **Then** all updated and recalculated values are displayed in preview mode with override indicators visible for manually adjusted fields.
>
> 8. **Given** the adjuster does not have PRIV>CAP>Adjudicate Settlement privilege,
>    **When** the adjuster attempts to access the Edit function,
>    **Then** the system denies access and displays an authorization error message.
>
> 9. **Given** an STD Claim settlement does not exist or is in an invalid state,
>    **When** the adjuster attempts to edit coverage data,
>    **Then** the system prevents editing and displays an appropriate state validation message.

#### Feature: As a Claims Adjuster, I want to manage year-to-date (YTD) earnings by adding, editing, and removing entries, so that I can maintain accurate earnings history for tax withholding calculations.
- **Role**: Claims Adjuster
- **Action**: add, edit, and remove year-to-date (YTD) earnings entries within an event case or claim
- **Value**: accurate earnings history is maintained for tax withholding calculations and financial settlement processing

**Description:**

> **As a** Claims Adjuster,
> **I want to** add, edit, and remove year-to-date (YTD) earnings entries within an event case or claim,
> **so that** accurate earnings history is maintained for tax withholding calculations and financial settlement processing.


**Key Capabilities:**

> 1. User initiates YTD Earnings management operations from the YTD Earnings interface within an event case or claim.
> 2. **Add New YTD Earnings**: User creates a new YTD earnings record by providing the year and earnings amount, which is validated and saved to the case.
> 3. **Edit Existing YTD Earnings**: User selects an existing YTD earnings entry for modification.
>    3.1. System displays pre-populated data from the original entry.
>    3.2. User updates the year and/or earnings amount.
>    3.3. System validates the changes and updates the record upon successful validation.
> 4. **Remove YTD Earnings**: User initiates removal of an existing YTD earnings entry.
>    4.1. System prompts for confirmation before deletion.
>    4.2. Upon confirmation, system removes the entry and updates the display.
>    4.3. If user cancels confirmation, no changes are made and the workflow exits.
> 5. **Data Validation**: System enforces business rules during add and edit operations.
>    5.1. If validation fails (duplicate year or invalid amount), system displays error messages and prevents saving.
>    5.2. User must correct the data before successfully completing the operation.
> 6. After successful completion of any operation (add, edit, or remove), the updated YTD earnings list is displayed in the interface.


**Acceptance Criteria:**

> 1. **Given** a Claims Adjuster is viewing an event case or claim with YTD Earnings UI, **When** the user initiates adding a new YTD Earnings entry with valid Year and Amount (greater than 0), **Then** the system saves the entry, updates the Event Case, and displays the new entry in the YTD Earnings UI.
> 2. **Given** the user is adding or editing a YTD Earnings entry, **When** the user enters a Year that already exists for this case or claim, **Then** the system displays an error message indicating year overlap and prevents saving.
> 3. **Given** the user is adding or editing a YTD Earnings entry, **When** the user enters a YTD Earnings Amount of 0 or less, **Then** the system displays an error message and prevents saving.
> 4. **Given** an existing YTD Earnings record is displayed, **When** the user clicks the edit icon, **Then** the system opens an in-line editing form with pre-populated data and disables the 'Add new' button and all other 'Edit' and 'Remove' icons.
> 5. **Given** the user is editing an existing YTD Earnings entry, **When** the user updates the fields with valid data and saves, **Then** the system validates the data, updates the record, and displays the modified entry in the YTD Earnings UI.
> 6. **Given** an existing YTD Earnings record is displayed, **When** the user clicks the Remove icon and confirms deletion, **Then** the system removes the entry and displays the updated YTD Earnings list.
> 7. **Given** the user initiates YTD Earnings removal, **When** the user does not confirm the deletion in the confirmation popup, **Then** the system closes the popup and no changes are made to the YTD Earnings records.
> 8. **Given** the user is in the process of adding a new YTD Earnings entry, **When** the form is open, **Then** the 'Add new' button is disabled to prevent concurrent additions.
> 9. **Given** any YTD Earnings operation (add, edit, remove) completes successfully, **When** the system processes the change, **Then** the Event Case is updated and the YTD Earnings UI reflects the current state of all earnings records.
> 10. **Given** the user has appropriate permissions, **When** accessing an event case or claim, **Then** the user can view and manage YTD Earnings entries for that case.

#### Feature: As a Claims Adjuster, I want to add, edit, and remove tax withholdings (Federal and State) with flexible amount or percentage options, so that I can adjust tax calculations based on claim-specific requirements.
- **Role**: Claims Adjuster
- **Action**: add, edit, and remove tax withholdings (Federal and State) with flexible amount or percentage options
- **Value**: I can adjust tax calculations based on claim-specific requirements

**Description:**

> **As a** Claims Adjuster,
> **I want to** add, edit, and remove tax withholdings (Federal and State) with flexible amount or percentage options,
> **so that** I can adjust tax calculations based on claim-specific requirements.


**Key Capabilities:**

> 1. User accesses the Manage Withholdings interface from the Event Case Taxes tab to view existing withholding entries with options to Add, Edit, or Remove.
> 2. To add a new tax withholding, user initiates the process and provides required tax configuration:
>    2.1 User selects Tax Type (Federal Tax or State Tax).
>    2.2 User defines tax amount using mutually exclusive options: either Dollar Amount (flat rate per benefit period) or Percentage (0-100% with up to two decimal places), with value greater than 0.
>    2.3 User specifies the effective period by entering From Date and Through Date, where Through Date must be later than From Date.
>    2.4 User selects applicable Claims from available STD, SMD, and LTD claims linked to Event Case (single claim required for dollar amount; multiple claims allowed for percentage based on Extra Withholding presence).
>    2.5 If State Tax is selected, user specifies the State with State Income Tax.
>    2.6 User optionally selects Filing Status for Federal or State taxes.
>    2.7 If percentage-based calculation is used, user may optionally enter Extra Withholding amount (must be greater than 0 if entered).
> 3. User saves the withholding configuration, which updates the case and displays the new entry in the Taxes tab.
> 4. To modify existing withholdings, user edits an entry which opens a pre-filled form with the same configuration options and validation rules.
> 5. To remove withholdings, user deletes an entry after confirming the removal action.
> 6. System applies tax calculation method based on entry type: flat rate per benefit period for dollar amounts, or percentage of benefit amounts for percentage-based entries.
> 7. User can cancel form entry at any time with confirmation, discarding unsaved changes and returning to the Taxes tab.
> 8. System enforces business rules including:
>    8.1 Restricting claims selection to income-related claim types (STD, SMD, LTD) that are not closed.
>    8.2 Adjusting Extra Withholding field visibility and Claims selection cardinality based on Tax Amount entry type.
>    8.3 Applying flat rates according to benefit period type (weekly for STD/SMP, monthly for LTD).
>    8.4 Allowing overlapping date periods for different withholding records.


**Acceptance Criteria:**

> 1. **Given** a Claims Adjuster accesses the Event Case Taxes tab, **When** the Manage Withholdings interface loads, **Then** all existing withholding entries are displayed with Add, Edit, and Remove action options.
> 2. **Given** user clicks 'Add Withholding' button, **When** the slide-out form opens, **Then** all required fields (Tax Type, Tax Amount, From Date, Through Date, Claims) are presented with appropriate validation.
> 3. **Given** user selects Federal Tax as Tax Type, **When** completing the form, **Then** State selection field is not required.
> 4. **Given** user selects State Tax as Tax Type, **When** completing the form, **Then** State selection field is required and populated with states from LU>TaxState that have state income tax.
> 5. **Given** user enters a Dollar Amount in Tax Amount field, **When** the field is populated, **Then** system sets tax type to FLAT, hides Extra Withholding field, and restricts Claims dropdown to single selection only.
> 6. **Given** user enters a Percentage in Tax Amount field, **When** the field is populated, **Then** system sets tax type to PERCENTAGE, displays Extra Withholding field as optional, and allows multiple Claims selection (subject to Extra Withholding restrictions).
> 7. **Given** user attempts to enter both Dollar Amount and Percentage, **When** one field is populated, **Then** system prevents entry in the other field as they are mutually exclusive.
> 8. **Given** user enters Tax Amount value of 0 or negative, **When** attempting to save, **Then** system displays validation error and prevents save, requiring value greater than 0.
> 9. **Given** user enters Extra Withholding value of 0 or negative, **When** the field is visible and attempting to save, **Then** system displays validation error and prevents save, requiring value greater than 0 if Extra Withholding is entered.
> 10. **Given** user enters Through Date earlier than or equal to From Date, **When** attempting to save, **Then** system displays validation error and prevents save, requiring Through Date to be later than From Date.
> 11. **Given** user attempts to save without completing required fields, **When** save is initiated, **Then** system displays validation errors for missing Tax Type, Tax Amount, From/Through Dates, Claims, or State (when Tax Type is State) and prevents save.
> 12. **Given** Claims dropdown is populated, **When** loading claim options, **Then** system retrieves only STD, SMD, and LTD claims linked to Event Case, excluding closed claims and non-income claims, displayed as Coverage Type + Loss Number.
> 13. **Given** user enters valid withholding configuration, **When** clicking Save button, **Then** form closes, case is updated with tax type stored in Attr>CapFinancialAdjustmentTax>taxType and calculation method in federalTaxType/stateTaxType attributes, and user returns to Event Case Taxes tab with new entry visible.
> 14. **Given** user clicks Edit icon on existing withholding entry, **When** Edit Withholding form opens, **Then** all fields are pre-filled with current values and follow same validation rules as Add operation.
> 15. **Given** user clicks Remove icon on existing withholding entry, **When** confirmation modal is displayed with Yes/No options, **Then** selecting Yes deletes the entry and refreshes interface, while selecting No closes modal without changes.
> 16. **Given** user clicks Cancel button or Close Icon (X) on Add/Edit Withholding form, **When** confirmation modal is displayed asking 'Are you sure you want to close the form?', **Then** selecting Yes closes form without saving and returns to Event Case Taxes tab, while selecting No keeps user in the form.
> 17. **Given** multiple withholding records exist with overlapping date periods, **When** viewing withholding entries, **Then** system allows and displays overlapping periods as permitted by business rules.
> 18. **Given** flat-rate dollar amount withholding is configured for STD/SMP claims, **When** tax calculation is applied, **Then** flat rate is applied per week per benefit period.
> 19. **Given** flat-rate dollar amount withholding is configured for LTD claims, **When** tax calculation is applied, **Then** flat rate is applied per month per benefit period.
> 20. **Given** percentage-based withholding is configured, **When** tax calculation is applied, **Then** percentage is applied to benefit amounts for selected claims.
> 21. **Given** Filing Status field is available, **When** user selects from dropdown, **Then** options are populated from LU>TaxMaritalStatus (Single, Married, etc.) and selection is optional for both Federal and State taxes.
> 22. **Given** the UI is implemented, **When** user interacts with the interface, **Then** design follows EIS DS Library design system with UXD mockups specifications from Figma.

#### Feature: As a Claims Adjuster, I want to specify tax withholding details including tax type, amount/percentage, extra withholding, date ranges, state, filing status, and applicable claims, so that tax calculations are precise and compliant with regulations.
- **Role**: Claims Adjuster
- **Action**: specify and manage tax withholding details including tax type, amount/percentage, extra withholding, date ranges, state, filing status, and applicable claims
- **Value**: tax calculations are precise, compliant with regulations, and accurately applied across relevant claims

**Description:**

> **As a** Claims Adjuster,
> **I want to** specify and manage tax withholding details including tax type, amount/percentage, extra withholding, date ranges, state, filing status, and applicable claims,
> **so that** tax calculations are precise, compliant with regulations, and accurately applied across relevant claims.


**Key Capabilities:**

> 1. User accesses the Manage Withholdings screen within an Event Case Taxes tab, viewing all existing withholdings with available actions (Add, Edit, Delete).
> 2. User initiates creation of a new withholding entry, which opens a structured input form for capturing all required tax withholding parameters.
> 3. User specifies the tax type from available manual withholding categories (excluding FICA), which determines subsequent field visibility and requirements.
>    3.1. If State tax type is selected, user must also specify the applicable state from jurisdictions with income tax requirements and may optionally provide filing status.
>    3.2. If Federal tax type is selected, user may optionally provide filing status information.
> 4. User defines the withholding amount using either a flat dollar amount or a percentage (mutually exclusive methods).
>    4.1. When dollar amount is specified, system applies flat withholding to a single selected claim and stores amounts appropriately based on claim type (weekly for STD/SMD, monthly for LTD).
>    4.2. When percentage is specified, user may select multiple applicable claims and optionally enter extra withholding amounts, with system enforcing single-claim selection when extra withholding is provided.
> 5. User establishes effective date range for the withholding (from/through dates), with system allowing overlapping periods within event cases.
> 6. User selects applicable claims from available STD/SMD/LTD claims linked to the event case, with system excluding closed claims and formatting display as coverage type plus loss number.
> 7. User saves the withholding configuration, which updates the event case tax records and returns to the taxes management view.
> 8. User modifies existing withholdings by selecting an entry for editing, updating desired fields while maintaining all field dependencies and business rules, and saving changes.
> 9. User removes obsolete withholdings by deleting entries with confirmation, updating the event case tax records accordingly.
> 10. User can abandon withholding creation or editing at any time with confirmation, preserving the current state of tax records.


**Acceptance Criteria:**

> 1. **Given** the user is on the Event Case Taxes tab, **When** they view the Manage Withholdings screen, **Then** the system displays all existing withholdings with Add, Edit, and Delete action buttons available.
> 2. **Given** the user clicks 'Add Withholding Button', **When** the form opens, **Then** the system displays a slide-out form titled 'Add Withholding' with Tax Type, Tax Amount, From/Through Dates, and Claims as required fields.
> 3. **Given** the user is adding a withholding, **When** they select Tax Type from the dropdown, **Then** the system populates only manual withholding types from LU>TaxType, excluding FICA.
> 4. **Given** the user selects Tax Type = State, **When** the field is populated, **Then** the system makes 'States with State Income Tax' field visible, required, and populated from LU>TaxState, and makes 'Filing Status' visible as optional.
> 5. **Given** the user selects Tax Type = Federal, **When** the field is populated, **Then** the system makes 'Filing Status' field visible as optional (sourced from LU>TaxMaritalStatus) and keeps 'States with State Income Tax' hidden.
> 6. **Given** the user is specifying Tax Amount, **When** they enter a Dollar Amount, **Then** the system disables the Percentage field, sets taxType as FLAT, hides 'Extra Withholding' field, restricts Claims dropdown to single selection, and stores value to Federal/State TaxWeeklyAmount (STD/SMP) or TaxMonthlyAmount (LTD).
> 7. **Given** the user is specifying Tax Amount, **When** they enter a Percentage (0-100%, up to 2 decimal places), **Then** the system disables the Dollar Amount field, sets taxType as PERCENTAGE, displays 'Extra Withholding' as optional, allows multi-selection in Claims dropdown, and stores value to Federal/State TaxPercentage.
>    7.1. **Given** the user enters a Percentage with Extra Withholding value >0, **When** the Extra Withholding field is populated, **Then** the system restricts Claims dropdown to single selection only.
> 8. **Given** the user is entering From/Through Dates, **When** they use MM/DD/YYYY format, **Then** the system accepts overlapping date periods within Event Cases and stores values to Attr>CapFinancialAdjustmentTax>term (effectiveDate/expirationDate).
> 9. **Given** the user is selecting Claims, **When** the Claims dropdown is displayed, **Then** the system shows STD/SMD/LTD claims linked via eventCaseLink in format '&lt;Coverage Type&gt; &lt;lossNumber&gt;', excludes closed claims, and stores selections to Federal/State lossSources.
> 10. **Given** all required fields are completed, **When** the user clicks 'Save Button', **Then** the system stores all withholding data (Tax Type to Attr>CapFinancialAdjustmentTax>taxType, State to CapFinancialAdjustmentTaxDetailsStateEntity.stateTaxState, Filing Status to State/Federal TaxMaritalStatus), closes the form, and returns to Event Case Taxes tab displaying the updated withholdings list.
> 11. **Given** the user selects 'Edit Icon' on an existing withholding, **When** the edit form opens, **Then** the system displays the slide-out form titled 'Edit Withholding' with all fields pre-populated with existing data, applies all field rules and dependencies, and updates the record upon Save.
> 12. **Given** the user selects 'Delete Icon' on an existing withholding, **When** the delete action is triggered, **Then** the system displays confirmation modal with message 'Are you sure you want to remove this entry?', removes the entry upon confirmation, and updates the Taxes tab.
> 13. **Given** the user clicks 'Cancel Button' or 'Close Icon' during Add/Edit, **When** the action is triggered, **Then** the system displays confirmation modal with message 'Are you sure you want to close the form?', closes without saving upon confirmation, or keeps form open with data intact if user cancels.
> 14. **Given** the user lacks privilege PRIV>CAP>Case: Update Taxes Details (Withholdings and YTD Earnings), **When** they access the Event Case Taxes tab, **Then** the system prevents Add, Edit, and Delete actions on withholdings.
> 15. **Given** required fields are missing (Tax Type, Tax Amount, From/Through Dates, Claims, or State when Tax Type = State), **When** the user attempts to save, **Then** the system blocks submission and displays inline error messages next to incomplete fields.

### Epic: Core Adjudication & Recalculation Engine

#### Feature: As a Claims Adjuster, I want to update claim details and automatically trigger settlement refresh, so that all related settlements reflect the most current claim information.
- **Role**: Claims Adjuster
- **Action**: update claim details and automatically trigger settlement refresh
- **Value**: all related settlements reflect the most current claim information

**Description:**

> **As a** Claims Adjuster,
> **I want to** update claim details and automatically trigger settlement refresh,
> **so that** all related settlements reflect the most current claim information.


**Key Capabilities:**

> 1. Claims Adjuster accesses an active Critical Illness claim that is in an eligible lifecycle state for modification (e.g., under review, pending adjudication, or open status).
> 2. Adjuster reviews and updates claim details that impact settlement calculations, including:
>    2.1. Critical illness diagnosis information and medical documentation
>    2.2. Policy coverage amounts and benefit eligibility
>    2.3. Claimant information and beneficiary details
>    2.4. Loss date or reporting information corrections
> 3. Upon saving claim detail updates, the system automatically validates changes against business rules for Critical Illness product requirements and policy terms.
> 4. System triggers automatic settlement recalculation process:
>    4.1. Identifies all settlements associated with the updated claim
>    4.2. Recalculates settlement amounts based on updated claim information
>    4.3. Applies product-specific adjudication rules and coverage limits
>    4.4. Updates settlement status and amounts in real-time
> 5. Adjuster reviews recalculated settlement information to verify accuracy and alignment with updated claim details.
> 6. System maintains audit trail of claim modifications and corresponding settlement adjustments for compliance and historical tracking.
> 7. Claim progresses through appropriate lifecycle transitions based on adjudication outcomes and settlement status.


**Acceptance Criteria:**

> 1. **Given** a Claims Adjuster accesses an active Critical Illness claim in an editable state, **when** they update claim details affecting settlement calculations, **then** the system automatically triggers settlement recalculation within 5 seconds of saving changes.
> 2. **Given** claim details have been updated, **when** settlement recalculation is triggered, **then** all settlements linked to the claim are identified and recalculated based on current claim information and product rules.
> 3. **Given** settlement recalculation is in progress, **when** the process completes, **then** updated settlement amounts and statuses are displayed to the Claims Adjuster without requiring manual refresh.
> 4. **Given** a claim update violates Critical Illness product business rules or policy eligibility criteria, **when** the Adjuster attempts to save changes, **then** the system blocks the update and displays specific validation error messages indicating which rules were violated.
> 5. **Given** multiple settlements exist for a single claim, **when** claim details are updated, **then** all related settlements reflect the changes consistently and simultaneously.
> 6. **Given** a Claims Adjuster updates claim information, **when** settlement recalculation occurs, **then** the system creates a complete audit trail capturing the original values, updated values, timestamp, and user identity.
> 7. **Given** a Critical Illness policy is not active or in force, **when** an Adjuster attempts to update claim details, **then** the system prevents modifications and displays a message indicating policy status requirements.
> 8. **Given** settlement recalculation has completed, **when** the Adjuster reviews the claim, **then** the system clearly indicates which settlements were recalculated and highlights any changes in settlement amounts or payment status.
> 9. **Given** a claim is in a closed or finalized state, **when** an Adjuster attempts to update claim details, **then** the system prevents modifications unless the claim is reopened through proper lifecycle transition.
> 10. **Given** settlement recalculation fails due to system error or data integrity issues, **when** the failure occurs, **then** the system retains original claim updates, logs the error, and notifies the Adjuster with actionable error information without data loss.

#### Feature: As a Claims Adjuster, I want to recalculate payment amounts whenever claim data changes, so that overpayments and underpayments are accurately identified.
- **Role**: Claims Adjuster
- **Action**: recalculate payment amounts whenever claim data changes, automatically identify overpayments and underpayments through balance calculation, and apply appropriate balance management actions
- **Value**: overpayments and underpayments are accurately identified and resolved, ensuring correct payment allocations, accurate accumulators, and proper financial reconciliation between carrier and insured

**Description:**

> **As a** Claims Adjuster,
> **I want to** recalculate payment amounts whenever claim data changes, automatically identify overpayments and underpayments through balance calculation, and apply appropriate balance management actions,
> **so that** overpayments and underpayments are accurately identified and resolved, ensuring correct payment allocations, accurate accumulators, and proper financial reconciliation between carrier and insured.


**Key Capabilities:**

> 1. System performs initial case and claim setup during intake, executing applicability rules to automatically determine and create appropriate claim types (STD, LTD, Life, etc.) based on available information.
> 2. System continuously monitors and tracks all user changes to event case, claim, and benefit details, displaying complete change history in UI history component.
> 3. System automatically triggers readjudication and payment recalculation whenever claim data is updated.
>    3.1. When updates occur before payment issuance, system recalculates payment schedule to reflect new amounts.
>    3.2. When updates occur after payments are scheduled or issued, system recalculates and updates payment schedule only (never modifying actual issued payments), enabling balance calculation against already-issued amounts.
>    3.3. When case data is updated with information that meets applicability criteria (e.g., adding death event), system automatically evaluates and creates additional claims as appropriate.
> 4. System executes balance calculation service to compare scheduled payment allocations against issued payment allocations and balance transaction allocations, incorporating expenses (money not related to payments/claims such as unpaid premium or excess refunds).
> 5. System interprets balance calculation results:
>    5.1. Balance = 0 indicates no money owed by either party.
>    5.2. Balance > 0 indicates carrier owes insured (underpayment situation).
>    5.3. Balance &lt; 0 indicates insured owes carrier (overpayment situation).
&gt; 6. Claims Adjuster applies balance management actions when balance becomes non-zero:
>    6.1. For overpayment (Balance &lt; 0), Adjuster selects from available options:
&gt;       6.1.1. Post Recovery: Used when no future payments exist; creates formal activity stating amount to be returned without additional payment transactions; impacts accumulators when recovery reaches 'issued' status.
>       6.1.2. Waive Overpayment: Reduces overpayment by amount decided to waive and not recover; impacts accumulators when waive reaches 'issued' status.
>       6.1.3. Reduce Payment (Overpayment Withholding): Used when future payments are planned; Adjuster selects withholding amount and system automatically withholds from subsequent payments until resolved; impacts accumulators when payment with withholding is issued.
>       6.1.4. Add External Overpayment: Posts overpayment from outside the specific claims case/claim; impacts total balance for payee and may require additional activities; does NOT impact accumulators.
>    6.2. For underpayment (Balance > 0), system uses specific underpayment payment type as balancing option; impacts accumulators during underpayment issuing and generation process.
> 7. Adjuster manually modifies payment allocations or adds new ones through payment management UI when necessary, triggering automatic recalculation.
> 8. System executes self-balancing process to automatically identify and offset balance items by generating self-balance transactions, ensuring correct ledger and accumulator numbers.
> 9. When balancing payment status changes (e.g., to cancelled) after initial processing, system re-impacts accumulators to reflect the status change.
> 10. System maintains balance management scope restriction: all balancing activities are performed per claim and payee, or per event case and payee only (cross-event case management not supported).


**Acceptance Criteria:**

> 1. **Given** a Claims Adjuster updates event case, claim, or benefit details before payment issuance, **When** the update is saved, **Then** the system automatically triggers readjudication and recalculates the payment schedule to reflect the new amounts within the current processing cycle.
> 2. **Given** a Claims Adjuster updates claim data after payments have been scheduled or issued, **When** the update is saved, **Then** the system recalculates and updates the payment schedule only without modifying any issued payment records, and all user changes are visible in the UI history component.
> 3. **Given** case data is updated with information that triggers applicability rules (e.g., adding death event), **When** the update is processed, **Then** the system automatically evaluates and creates additional claims if sufficient information exists to meet claim type criteria.
> 4. **Given** payment schedule updates have occurred, **When** the balance calculation service runs, **Then** the system compares scheduled payment allocations against issued payment allocations and balance transaction allocations, incorporating expenses, and produces a balance result.
> 5. **Given** balance calculation completes, **When** Balance = 0, **Then** the system indicates no money is owed by either party and no balance management action is required.
> 6. **Given** balance calculation completes, **When** Balance > 0 (carrier owes insured), **Then** the system identifies an underpayment situation and enables the Claims Adjuster to apply underpayment payment type, which impacts accumulators during underpayment issuing and generation.
> 7. **Given** balance calculation completes, **When** Balance &lt; 0 (insured owes carrier), **Then** the system identifies an overpayment situation and enables the Claims Adjuster to select from four balance management options: Post Recovery, Waive Overpayment, Reduce Payment (Overpayment Withholding), or Add External Overpayment.
&gt; 8. **Given** an overpayment exists with no future payments planned, **When** the Claims Adjuster selects Post Recovery, **Then** the system creates a formal recovery activity without additional payment transactions and impacts accumulators when the recovery reaches 'issued' status.
> 9. **Given** an overpayment exists, **When** the Claims Adjuster selects Waive Overpayment with a specified amount, **Then** the system reduces the overpayment by the waived amount and impacts accumulators when the waive reaches 'issued' status.
> 10. **Given** an overpayment exists with future payments planned, **When** the Claims Adjuster selects Reduce Payment (Overpayment Withholding) and specifies withholding amount, **Then** the system automatically withholds the specified amount from subsequent payments until the overpayment is resolved, and impacts accumulators when each payment with withholding is issued.
> 11. **Given** an overpayment from outside the specific claims case/claim needs to be recorded, **When** the Claims Adjuster selects Add External Overpayment, **Then** the system posts the overpayment, impacts total balance for the payee, does NOT impact accumulators, and may require additional activities.
> 12. **Given** the Claims Adjuster manually modifies payment allocations or adds new ones through payment management UI, **When** the changes are saved, **Then** the system automatically triggers payment recalculation.
> 13. **Given** a balancing payment (Recovery, Waive, Withholding, or Underpayment) has been processed, **When** its status changes to cancelled, **Then** the system re-impacts accumulators to reflect the status change and maintain accurate benefit limit tracking.
> 14. **Given** the self-balancing process is executed, **When** balance items are identified, **Then** the system automatically generates self-balance transactions to offset balance items and ensure correct ledger and accumulator numbers.
> 15. **Given** a Claims Adjuster attempts to manage balance across multiple event cases, **When** the action is initiated, **Then** the system prevents the action and enforces balance management scope restriction to per claim and payee, or per event case and payee only.
> 16. **Given** any balance management action is applied (except Add External Overpayment), **When** the action reaches its defined timing point (Recovery and Waive at 'issued' status; Withholding when payment issued; Underpayment during issuing/generation), **Then** the system impacts accumulators by increasing or decreasing used amounts accordingly.

#### Feature: As a Claims Adjuster, I want to adjust absence case data (tax withholdings, deductions, absence reasons, work details) and trigger automatic re-adjudication, so that claims are created and payments are recalculated based on updated information.
- **Role**: Claims Adjuster
- **Action**: adjust absence case data (tax withholdings, deductions, absence reasons, work details) and trigger automatic re-adjudication
- **Value**: claims are created and payments are recalculated based on updated information

**Description:**

> **As a** Claims Adjuster,
> **I want to** adjust absence case data (tax withholdings, deductions, absence reasons, work details) and trigger automatic re-adjudication,
> **so that** claims are created and payments are recalculated based on updated information.


**Key Capabilities:**

> 1. Case Adjuster verifies that the Absence Case has status 'Incomplete' or 'Open' before initiating any adjustment activities.
> 2. Case Adjuster performs data adjustment activities in any order and as many times as needed, including:
>    2.1 Managing Federal Income Tax (FIT) withholdings for underlying claims by entering flat dollar amounts with date ranges (system prorates across overlapping payment allocations) or percentages with date ranges (system applies to taxable amounts when payment post date falls within range).
>    2.2 Managing deductions applicable to one or many underlying claims by entering flat dollar amounts per week or percentages, designating pre-tax or post-tax application, and specifying from and through dates.
>    2.3 Managing absence reasons, which triggers automated re-adjudication flow.
>    2.4 Managing absence type, participant work days/hours, YTD earnings, absence events, absence periods, party information, occupation class, preferred payment method, payment frequency, and absence dates.
> 3. System updates the Absence Case data based on user edits and saves changes.
> 4. System automatically initiates processing workflows based on the type of data changes:
>    4.1 When tax withholdings, deductions, or other payment-impacting data is updated, system automatically recalculates payment amounts.
>    4.2 When absence reason or data affecting case applicability is updated, system automatically submits the Absence Case (if status is 'Incomplete'), evaluates case applicability to identify applicable claim types, re-evaluates eligibility and calculates Gross Benefit Amount (GBA), creates new claim types if applicable and not already created, and recalculates payments.
>    4.3 If Absence Case status was 'Incomplete' during re-adjudication, system may update status to 'Open' after processing.
> 5. System retains existing claims even when Absence Case is no longer applicable for those claims after re-adjudication (claims are not deleted).
> 6. Upon completion, the adjuster can continue to the Manage Payments and Financials process, repeat the adjustment process, or initiate claim or case closure.


**Acceptance Criteria:**

> 1. **Given** an Absence Case with status 'Complete' or 'Closed', **when** the Case Adjuster attempts to adjust data, **then** the system prevents data modification and displays an appropriate status message.
> 2. **Given** an Absence Case with status 'Incomplete' or 'Open', **when** the Case Adjuster accesses the case, **then** the system allows all adjustment activities to be performed.
> 3. **Given** a Federal Income Tax withholding entered as a flat dollar amount with from and through dates, **when** the system processes payment allocations, **then** the withholding is applied only to allocations with dates overlapping the specified range and prorated when necessary.
> 4. **Given** a Federal Income Tax withholding entered as a percentage with beginning and through dates, **when** the payment post date falls within the specified range, **then** the FIT withholding percentage is applied to the taxable amount of that allocation.
> 5. **Given** a deduction entered as a flat dollar amount per week or percentage with pre-tax or post-tax designation, **when** the system calculates payments, **then** the deduction is applied correctly according to the specified parameters and date range to all applicable underlying claims.
> 6. **Given** the Case Adjuster updates tax withholdings or deductions, **when** the changes are saved, **then** the system automatically recalculates payment amounts reflecting the updated values.
> 7. **Given** the Case Adjuster updates the absence reason or other applicability-affecting data, **when** the changes are saved, **then** the system automatically initiates the re-adjudication flow including submission, applicability evaluation, eligibility evaluation, GBA calculation, and claim creation.
> 8. **Given** an Absence Case with status 'Incomplete' when absence reason is updated, **when** re-adjudication is triggered, **then** the system submits the Absence Case, executes automated adjudication processes, and may update the status to 'Open'.
> 9. **Given** re-adjudication results in the Absence Case no longer being applicable to existing claims, **when** the process completes, **then** the system retains all existing claims without deletion.
> 10. **Given** re-adjudication identifies new applicable claim types, **when** the evaluation process completes, **then** the system automatically creates the new claim types if they were not previously created.
> 11. **Given** multiple data adjustment activities are performed, **when** the Case Adjuster saves changes after each activity, **then** the system allows activities to be performed multiple times in any order without restriction.
> 12. **Given** all adjustment activities are completed, **when** the Case Adjuster finalizes updates, **then** the system enables continuation to Manage Payments and Financials process or allows the adjuster to repeat the adjustment process or initiate claim/case closure.

#### Feature: As a Claims Adjuster, I want to trigger payment recalculation when specific claim attributes change (coverage amounts, dates, deductions, offsets, taxable percentages), so that payment schedules are updated to reflect the correct benefit amounts.
- **Role**: Claims Adjuster
- **Action**: trigger payment recalculation when specific claim attributes change (coverage amounts, dates, deductions, offsets, taxable percentages)
- **Value**: payment schedules are updated to reflect the correct benefit amounts and overpay/underpay balances are automatically generated

**Description:**

> **As a** Claims Adjuster,
> **I want to** trigger payment recalculation when specific claim attributes change (coverage amounts, dates, deductions, offsets, taxable percentages),
> **so that** payment schedules are updated to reflect the correct benefit amounts and overpay/underpay balances are automatically generated.


**Key Capabilities:**

> 1. User modifies case-level attributes that trigger payment recalculation across all affected claims:
>    1.1 Change Actively At Work (AAW) Date which cascades to claim level and triggers recalculation for all affected allocations and claims.
>    1.2 Add retroactive ancillary activities such as rehabilitation services.
>    1.3 Add or change retroactive deductions.
>    1.4 Add retroactive tax withholding.
>    1.5 Execute reduce payment action.
>    1.6 Change FICA Social Security exempt or FICA Medicare exempt attributes.
> 2. User modifies claim-level attributes that trigger payment recalculation for specific claims:
>    2.1 Update Face Value which recalculates gross amount of settlement and allocation amounts.
>    2.2 Update Annual Covered Earnings (when editable) which recalculates face value and subsequent settlement amounts.
>    2.3 Change Covered Earnings on a disability claim.
>    2.4 Add or change retroactive offsets including automatic offsets.
>    2.5 Change Gross Benefit Amount of a coverage.
>    2.6 Change Elimination Period end date or Benefit Period start/end dates.
>    2.7 Change Taxable percentage of a disability claim.
>    2.8 Change Current Earnings value of a Partial Disability payment.
> 3. Upon any attribute modification, user saves the changes which initiates automated recalculation process.
> 4. System recalculates Gross Amount of Settlement based on the modified attribute values.
> 5. System recalculates Allocation amounts for all affected payments.
> 6. System automatically generates new balance records when existing issued payment records exist:
>    6.1 System calculates underpay balance when new calculated amount exceeds previously issued payment.
>    6.2 System calculates overpay balance when new calculated amount is less than previously issued payment.
> 7. System completes recalculation and makes updated payment schedules and balance records available for review and action.


**Acceptance Criteria:**

> 1. **Given** a claim with an existing issued payment of $5,000 with face value of $5,000,
>    **When** the Claims Adjuster updates the face value to $6,000 and clicks Save,
>    **Then** the system recalculates the gross amount of death coverage to $6,000 and generates an underpay balance record of $1,000.
> 2. **Given** a disability claim with existing payment records,
>    **When** the Claims Adjuster changes the Taxable percentage and saves,
>    **Then** the system recalculates the Gross Amount of Settlement, Allocation amounts, and generates a new balance record reflecting the difference.
> 3. **Given** multiple claims associated with a single event case,
>    **When** the Claims Adjuster changes the Actively At Work (AAW) Date at the case level,
>    **Then** the system cascades the change to all affected claims and triggers payment recalculation for all related allocations.
> 4. **Given** a claim with issued payments,
>    **When** the Claims Adjuster adds a retroactive deduction and saves,
>    **Then** the system recalculates the Gross Amount of Settlement, Allocation amounts, and generates an overpay balance record if applicable.
> 5. **Given** a disability claim,
>    **When** the Claims Adjuster updates Annual Covered Earnings (when editable) and saves,
>    **Then** the system recalculates the face value based on the new earnings, recalculates settlement and allocation amounts, and generates balance records if existing payments exist.
> 6. **Given** a claim with existing payment records,
>    **When** the Claims Adjuster changes the Elimination Period end date or Benefit Period dates,
>    **Then** the system recalculates all affected payment allocations and generates appropriate balance records.
> 7. **Given** a claim with previously issued payments,
>    **When** the Claims Adjuster adds or changes a retroactive offset and saves,
>    **Then** the system recalculates settlement amounts and generates balance records reflecting overpay or underpay amounts.
> 8. **Given** a claim requiring payment reduction,
>    **When** the Claims Adjuster triggers the reduce payment action with corresponding data and saves,
>    **Then** the system recalculates the Gross Amount of Settlement, Allocation amounts, and generates appropriate balance records.
> 9. **Given** any attribute change that triggers recalculation,
>    **When** no existing issued payment records exist,
>    **Then** the system recalculates settlement and allocation amounts without generating balance records.
> 10. **Given** a case with retroactive ancillary activities,
>     **When** the Claims Adjuster adds rehabilitation services and saves,
>     **Then** the system triggers recalculation for all affected payment schedules and generates balance records as needed.

#### Feature: As a Claims Adjuster, I want to view and manage balance transactions (issued payments, scheduled payments, balance adjustments) per payee, so that I can accurately determine overpayment or underpayment amounts.
- **Role**: Claims Adjuster
- **Action**: view and manage balance transactions (issued payments, scheduled payments, balance adjustments) per payee
- **Value**: I can accurately determine overpayment or underpayment amounts and take appropriate corrective actions

**Description:**

> **As a** Claims Adjuster,
> **I want to** view and manage balance transactions (issued payments, scheduled payments, balance adjustments) per payee,
> **so that** I can accurately determine overpayment or underpayment amounts and take appropriate corrective actions.


**Key Capabilities:**

> 1. User selects a specific payee as a mandatory precondition for balance review and management.
> 2. System generates and displays balance data for the selected payee, including balance list and balance activities list through the Balance UI component.
> 3. User previews current balance status and reviews transaction history via the Balance Overview interface.
> 4. When payee balance is non-zero, user accesses balance management actions from the Action menu.
> 5. User executes balance correction actions based on specific scenarios:
>    5.1 **Reduce Payment (Overpayment Withholding)** - When overpayment exists and future payments are planned:
>       - User selects 'Reduce payment' action and configures withholding amount.
>       - System applies overpayment withholding during payment scheduling process.
>       - Amount impacts total balance only when payment containing withholding is issued (increases total balance).
>       - Issued recovery impacts the accumulator.
>    5.2 **Post Recovery** - When recovery needs to be recorded:
>       - User adds recovery through Balance UI Action section.
>       - System immediately generates recovery payment with 'issued' status.
>       - Transaction appears in Balance UI and Payment and Recovery List UI.
>       - Amount impacts total balance upon saving recovery data (increases total balance).
>       - Issued recovery impacts the accumulator.
>    5.3 **Waive Overpayment** - When overpayment exists and waiver is appropriate:
>       - User adds overpayment waive (action only available if overpayment exists in balance).
>       - Amount impacts total balance on saving transaction data (increases total balance).
>       - Issued overpayment waive impacts the accumulator.
>    5.4 **Add External Overpayment** - When external overpayment needs to be recorded (always available):
>       - User adds external overpayment through Balance UI Action section.
>       - Amount impacts total balance on saving transaction data (increases total balance).
>       - Exception: External overpayment does NOT impact the accumulator.
>    5.5 **Pay Underpayment** - When underpayment needs to be compensated:
>       - User adds underpayment through Balance UI Action section.
>       - System generates underpayment payment with 'pending' status.
>       - Payment appears in Payment and Recovery List UI and proceeds through approval and issuance workflow.
>       - Amount impacts total balance only upon payment issuance (decreases total balance).
>       - User optionally selects to compensate withholding.
> 6. User views generated payments and recoveries in Payment and Recovery List UI for review and tracking.
> 7. User accesses change history through Common UI Component - History and Case Overview - History interfaces for audit purposes.
> 8. User updates case data through Case Overview interface, with case updates remaining independent and not cascading to disability claims.
> 9. User updates claim data through Claim Overview interface with policy refresh capabilities available for both AH Disability and LA Life products.


**Acceptance Criteria:**

> 1. **Given** a Claims Adjuster accesses the Balance UI **without** selecting a payee, **When** attempting to view balance data, **Then** the system prompts for mandatory payee selection and does not display balance information.
> 2. **Given** a payee is selected, **When** the Claims Adjuster views the Balance Overview, **Then** the system displays the balance list, balance activities list, and current total balance within 2 seconds.
> 3. **Given** the selected payee has a zero balance, **When** the Claims Adjuster views the Action menu, **Then** only the 'Add External Overpayment' action is available (always available regardless of balance).
> 4. **Given** the selected payee has a non-zero balance, **When** the Claims Adjuster views the Action menu, **Then** all applicable balance management actions are displayed (Recovery, Overpayment Waive, Payment Reduction, Underpayment, External Overpayment).
> 5. **Given** there is no overpayment in the balance, **When** the Claims Adjuster attempts to select 'Waive Overpayment', **Then** the action is disabled or not displayed in the Action menu.
> 6. **Given** an overpayment exists and future payments are planned, **When** the Claims Adjuster configures and saves a 'Reduce Payment' withholding, **Then** the system applies the withholding during payment scheduling and the total balance increases only when the payment is issued.
> 7. **Given** a Claims Adjuster posts a recovery, **When** the recovery is saved, **Then** the system immediately generates a recovery payment with 'issued' status, displays the transaction in Balance UI, updates the total balance immediately (increase), and impacts the accumulator.
> 8. **Given** a Claims Adjuster adds an external overpayment, **When** the transaction is saved, **Then** the system updates the total balance immediately (increase) but does NOT impact the accumulator.
> 9. **Given** a Claims Adjuster adds an underpayment payment, **When** the underpayment is saved, **Then** the system generates a payment with 'pending' status, displays it in Payment and Recovery List UI, and updates the total balance only upon payment issuance (decrease).
> 10. **Given** a balance transaction has been created, **When** the Claims Adjuster attempts to cancel or modify the transaction via UI, **Then** the system prevents the action (current UI limitation, backend operations allow cancellation).
> 11. **Given** any balance management action is performed, **When** the Claims Adjuster views the change history, **Then** the system displays the transaction details, timestamp, and user information through the History interface.
> 12. **Given** a Claims Adjuster updates case data through Case Overview, **When** the case is associated with a disability claim, **Then** the system saves the case updates without cascading changes to the disability claim.
> 13. **Given** a Claims Adjuster updates claim data through Claim Overview, **When** the claim is for AH Disability or LA Life products, **Then** the system provides policy refresh capabilities and saves the claim updates successfully.
> 14. **Given** multiple balance transactions exist for a payee, **When** the Claims Adjuster reviews the Balance Activities List, **Then** all transactions are displayed with their status, amount, transaction type, and impact on total balance in chronological order.
> 15. **Given** an underpayment payment with the 'compensate withholding' option, **When** the payment is issued, **Then** the system correctly applies the withholding compensation and reflects the adjustment in the total balance.

#### Feature: As a Claims Adjuster, I want to apply COLA adjustments to disability payments based on policy parameters and anniversary dates, so that benefit amounts are correctly increased according to cost-of-living adjustments.
- **Role**: Claims Adjuster
- **Action**: apply COLA adjustments to disability payments based on policy parameters and anniversary dates
- **Value**: benefit amounts are correctly increased according to cost-of-living adjustments

**Description:**

> **As a** Claims Adjuster,
> **I want to** apply COLA adjustments to disability payments based on policy parameters and anniversary dates,
> **so that** benefit amounts are correctly increased according to cost-of-living adjustments.


**Key Capabilities:**

> 1. System verifies all preconditions are met before applying COLA, including configuration of COLA parameters, calculation of Anniversary date, and calculation of accumulated adjustment percentage.
>   1.1 If any precondition is not satisfied, COLA calculation is blocked and payment proceeds without adjustment until preconditions are met.
> 2. System evaluates payment eligibility against three distinct criteria sets to determine COLA applicability.
>   2.1 Coverage Type: COLA applies only to Main LTD coverage payments; expense payments, ex-gratia payments, and interest payments are excluded.
>   2.2 Payee Requirement: COLA applies only when the member is the payee; payments to different payees are excluded regardless of other criteria.
>   2.3 Disability Status: Full disability payments always receive COLA; partial disability payments receive COLA only if the parameter 'COLA Applies to the Partial Disability' is set to Yes.
>   2.4 If payment is before the first Anniversary Date, COLA does not apply.
> 3. System determines the calculation basis according to policy configuration for eligible payments.
>   3.1 For Net Benefit policies: COLA applies to AGBA (Adjusted Gross Benefit Amount), calculated as GBA minus Offsets, where GBA includes only main benefit (Core or BuyUp) excluding Rehab and other additions.
>   3.2 For Gross Benefit policies: COLA applies to GBA (Gross Benefit Amount) before offsets, where GBA includes only main benefit excluding additional benefits.
>   3.3 For partial disability when allowed: Net Benefit policies apply same adjustments as AGBA calculation but exclude offsets; Gross Benefit policies apply same adjustments as AGBA but do not apply offsets.
> 4. System calculates COLA adjustment amount using the formula: COLA $ = (AGBA or GBA per policy rules) × accumulated COLA percentage.
>   4.1 COLA is calculated on a monthly basis with automatic proration by 30 days for partial month payment periods.
>   4.2 For mid-month COLA effective dates, the system applies the percentage calculated for the first day of the payment period.
>   4.3 For payments covering periods less than a full month, both the calculation basis (GBA or AGBA) and the resulting COLA amount are prorated with explicit reflection of payment percentage, from dates, and through dates.
> 5. System stores COLA amount separately as a distinct component to clearly identify the portion of benefit representing cost-of-living increase.
> 6. System applies financial treatment rules to COLA adjustments.
>   6.1 COLA is taxed identically to main coverage benefits including FICA, Federal, and State taxes.
>   6.2 COLA is subject to the same deductions as AGBA.
>   6.3 COLA increase is excluded from maximum benefit amount calculations defined or calculated by policy data.
> 7. System excludes specific benefit components from COLA calculation basis, including Rehab Incentive Benefit, Survivor Benefits, and other additions beyond main LTD coverage.
> 8. System triggers COLA recalculation in response to standard conditions (GBA changes, approval periods changes, payment allocations changes) and COLA-specific conditions.
>   8.1 Payment-level triggers: Payee changes, approval period changes to/from Partial Disability status, approval period removals or status changes, Date of Loss changes, Offsets changes, payment schedule updates, and payment status changes.
>   8.2 Policy-level triggers: Policy data updates during adjudication, adjuster-initiated policy refresh, COLA value changes or any changes impacting GBA or payment data.
>   8.3 When policy percentage type changes from CPI to Fixed during active claim, system recalculates COLA using Compound approach regardless of standard Fixed calculation method.
> 9. System reflects all COLA-related changes in the Balance once at least one payment is issued, including payment rescheduling after issuance, Recovery posting, Underpayment payment, and Auto balancing scenarios.
> 10. Payment is issued with COLA adjustment incorporated and properly documented.


**Acceptance Criteria:**

> 1. **Given** COLA parameters are not configured OR Anniversary date is not calculated OR accumulated percentage is not calculated, **When** a payment is processed, **Then** the system blocks COLA calculation and processes the payment without COLA adjustment.
> 2. **Given** all preconditions are met and payment is for Main LTD coverage with member as payee for full disability, **When** the payment date is on or after the first Anniversary Date, **Then** the system applies COLA adjustment to the eligible payment.
> 3. **Given** a payment is for expense, ex-gratia, or interest (flagged as 'Is Interest'), **When** COLA eligibility is evaluated, **Then** the system excludes this payment from COLA calculations regardless of other criteria.
> 4. **Given** the payee is different from the member, **When** COLA eligibility is evaluated, **Then** the system excludes this payment from COLA calculations regardless of coverage type or disability status.
> 5. **Given** a partial disability payment and parameter 'COLA Applies to the Partial Disability' is set to No, **When** COLA eligibility is evaluated, **Then** the system does not apply COLA to the payment.
> 6. **Given** a partial disability payment and parameter 'COLA Applies to the Partial Disability' is set to Yes, **When** COLA eligibility is evaluated, **Then** the system applies COLA according to the disability calculation method.
> 7. **Given** a Net Benefit policy with full disability payment, **When** COLA is calculated, **Then** the system applies COLA to AGBA (GBA minus Offsets) where GBA includes only main benefit.
> 8. **Given** a Gross Benefit policy with full disability payment, **When** COLA is calculated, **Then** the system applies COLA to GBA before offsets where GBA includes only main benefit.
> 9. **Given** a payment allocation period is less than a full month, **When** COLA is calculated, **Then** the system prorates both the calculation basis and COLA amount by 30 days with explicit payment percentage, from dates, and through dates.
> 10. **Given** COLA becomes effective mid-month, **When** COLA percentage is applied, **Then** the system uses the percentage calculated for the first day of the payment period.
> 11. **Given** COLA has been calculated for a payment, **When** the payment is processed, **Then** the system stores the COLA amount separately and distinctly from other benefit components.
> 12. **Given** COLA is applied to a payment, **When** taxation is calculated, **Then** the system applies FICA, Federal, and State taxes to COLA identically to main coverage benefits.
> 13. **Given** COLA is applied to a payment, **When** deductions are calculated, **Then** the system applies the same deductions to COLA as applied to AGBA.
> 14. **Given** COLA has been applied to a payment, **When** maximum benefit amount is calculated, **Then** the system excludes the COLA increase from the maximum benefit threshold calculation.
> 15. **Given** a payment includes Rehab Incentive Benefit, Survivor Benefits, or other additions, **When** COLA calculation basis is determined, **Then** the system excludes these components and calculates COLA only on main benefit (Core or BuyUp).
> 16. **Given** at least one payment has been issued with COLA, **When** GBA changes OR approval periods change OR payment allocations change, **Then** the system triggers COLA recalculation for affected payments.
> 17. **Given** at least one payment has been issued with COLA, **When** payee changes OR approval period changes to/from Partial Disability OR Date of Loss changes OR Offsets change OR payment schedule updates OR payment status changes, **Then** the system triggers payment-level COLA recalculation.
