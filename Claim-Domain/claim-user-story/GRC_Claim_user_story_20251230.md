Given a complete dental claim with valid coverage, When the claim is adjudicated and settlement approved, Then payment schedule is activated, payments are generated with validated CHECK/EFT methods, and claim progresses to closed status upon successful dispatch.

**Predetermination Claim Handling**
Given a predetermination claim with PREDET-APPROVE proposal, When settlement is adjudicated, Then benefit amount is calculated and returned without payment issuance, accumulators are not reserved, and claim closes with 'Predetermined' reason.

**Payment Method Validation Enforcement**
Given a payment schedule with recipient payment methods, When payment generation executes, Then system filters to CHECK/EFT methods only, validates effective/expiration dates, and generates critical validation messages if provider is inactive or payment method invalid.

**Payment Dispatch Failure Recovery**
Given a payment request that fails during dispatch to Payment Hub, When the failure is detected, Then system triggers 'Request Issue Payment Failed' lifecycle command and prevents claim closure until resolution.

**Settlement Disapproval Path**
Given a settlement requiring additional review, When the adjuster disapproves the settlement, Then loss is closed without payment processing and claim remains open for further investigation.

**Address Resolution for Check Payments**
Given a CHECK payment method, When system resolves recipient address, Then mailing address with 'MailingAddressForCheck' preference is selected (or preferred/latest temporary address if not available), excluding invalid temporary addresses based on effective dates.

I want to **validate dental procedures against policy coverage rules and execute automated adjudication logic to determine claim settlement decisions**,
So that **claims are processed consistently according to policy terms, reducing manual review time while ensuring accurate benefit determinations and timely claim resolution**


**Key Capabilities:**

**1. Claim Intake and Categorization**
System receives dental claim and classifies by transaction type (Actual Services, Orthodontic Services, Predetermination-Actual, Predetermination-Orthodontics) to determine applicable adjudication pathway.

**2. Policy Coverage Validation**
System validates procedure sub-types (Implants, Orthodontics, TMJ, Cosmetic Services) against master policy coverage definitions; procedures with null coverage are immediately denied.

**3. Sequential Rule Execution**
System executes adjudication rules in priority sequence (Allow→Deny→Duplicate→Frequency→Combine→Review Required); first non-null result determines decision; null results default to Allowed.

**4. Settlement Proposal Generation**
Based on procedure decisions, system generates settlement proposal (PEND for review required, PAY for approved actual services, DENY for all denied, PREDET-APPROVE/DENY for predeterminations) and executes corresponding workflow actions.

**5. Preauthorization Validation**
For actual service claims, system validates date of service against preauthorization history; matching authorized predeterminations within authorization period allow procedures, while missing or expired preauthorizations trigger denials.

**6. Professional Review Routing**
When procedures trigger Review Required status (tooth/age mismatches, supernumerary teeth), system suspends adjudication, creates review task, and routes to professional review queue for manual override decision.


**Acceptance Criteria:**

**1. Coverage Validation Enforcement**
Given a procedure sub-type requiring explicit policy coverage, When coverage definition is null for that sub-type, Then procedure is denied with coverage reason code and no further rules are evaluated.

**2. Rule Priority Execution**
Given multiple adjudication rules configured for a procedure, When rules are executed in sequence priority order, Then the first rule returning non-null result determines final decision and subsequent rules are skipped.

**3. Frequency Limitation Compliance**
Given a procedure with frequency restrictions (per calendar year, in X months, lifetime), When patient history contains previous procedures of same sub-type within restricted period, Then current procedure is denied with frequency violation message.

**4. Automated Settlement Routing**
Given completed procedure adjudication, When all procedures are allowed for actual service claim, Then system generates PAY proposal, creates scheduled payments, and auto-closes claim when payments complete.

**5. Preauthorization Dependency**
Given an actual service claim requiring preauthorization, When no matching predetermination exists with authorized status and date of service within authorization period, Then procedure is denied for missing preauthorization data.

**6. Professional Review Suspension**
Given at least one procedure with Review Required decision, When settlement proposal is generated, Then system sets claim to Pending status, creates review task, assigns to professional review queue, and suspends adjudication until manual decision is recorded.

So that **dependent benefits (e.g., Anesthesia, Burn Skin Graft, Rehabilitation) are automatically re-evaluated when parent benefit changes occur, reducing manual rework and preventing payment inconsistencies**


**Key Capabilities:**

**1. Detect Parent Benefit Readjudication Trigger**
Upon parent settlement re-adjudication (e.g., Surgery gross amount changes), system identifies associated child settlements via benefit linkage rules.

**2. Propagate Changes to Dependent Settlements**
System refreshes child settlement data and determines which components require recalculation (gross amount vs. eligibility).

**3. Execute Conditional Recalculation**
System recalculates child gross amounts when parent amounts change, unless user override exists; re-runs eligibility rules when parent date ranges change, excluding overridden rules with mandatory status.

**4. Finalize Cascaded Settlement Status**
System assigns child settlement status (Approved/Pending/Disapprove) based on updated eligibility results, critical validation messages, and recalculated gross amounts.


**Acceptance Criteria:**

**1. Parent Surgery Benefit Triggers Child Anesthesia Recalculation**
Given a Surgery settlement with associated Anesthesia child settlement, When Surgery gross amount is updated and re-adjudicated, Then Anesthesia gross amount is automatically recalculated unless user override flag exists.

**2. Parent Burn Benefit Cascades to Skin Graft Settlement**
Given a Burn settlement with size amounts defined, When Burn gross amount changes during re-adjudication, Then Burn Skin Graft child settlement gross amount is recalculated reflecting parent changes.

**3. Hospital Confinement Date Change Triggers Rehabilitation Eligibility Re-evaluation**
Given Hospital Confinement settlement with end date modification, When re-adjudication occurs, Then Rehab Unit and Skilled Nursing child settlements re-execute eligibility rules unless explicitly overridden.

**4. System Honors User Overrides During Cascading**
Given child settlement has gross amount or eligibility override set, When parent settlement triggers cascading logic, Then system skips recalculation for overridden components but processes non-overridden elements.

**4. Calculate Coinsurance Obligations**
System retrieves applicable coinsurance rate by procedure type, network status, and policy year (if graded). Computes coinsurance on post-deductible amount.

**5. Enforce Maximum Limits**
System retrieves remaining maximum amounts from annual/lifetime accumulators. Determines benefit as lesser of coinsurance calculation and available maximum.

**6. Finalize Payment and Responsibilities**
System updates accumulator balances with benefit amounts. Calculates patient responsibility as difference between considered fee and approved benefit.


**Acceptance Criteria:**

**1. Covered Fee Determination**
Given in-network provider with fee schedule, when submitted charges exceed schedule amounts, then system uses fee schedule amount as basis for benefit calculation.

**2. Deductible Application**
Given preventive procedure with remaining individual deductible of $50 and covered fee of $100, when calculating benefits, then system reserves $50 to deductible and applies coinsurance to remaining $50.

**3. Graded Coinsurance Handling**
Given policy year 2 with graded coinsurance enabled, when adjudicating major procedure, then system retrieves year-specific coinsurance rate from policy definition.

**4. Maximum Limit Enforcement**
Given coinsurance calculation yields $500 but annual maximum remaining is $300, when finalizing benefit, then system approves $300 and updates accumulator to zero remaining.

**5. Combined Procedure Logic**
Given multiple radiographs on same date with combined-max rule, when processing second procedure, then system calculates remaining allowance from maximum covered procedure amount.

**6. Re-adjudication Reversal**
Given claim with issued payment undergoing re-adjudication, when recalculating benefits, then system reverts accumulator amounts to pre-payment state before applying new calculations.

**Key Capabilities:**

**1. Automated Payment Generation**
System consumes active payment schedules and generates actual payments when scheduled dates arrive. Upon payment schedule approval, generation rules filter eligible payments and create payment records with 'Approved' status.

**2. Payment Issuing and Hub Integration**
System collects approved payments and dispatches requests to Payment Hub. Upon successful validation, outbound transactions are created and payment status advances to 'Issued'.

**3. Financial Reconciliation**
System updates accumulators by moving amounts from reserved to used categories. Upon each payment issuance, balancing logic compares scheduled versus actual amounts and calculates discrepancies per payee.

**4. Exception Handling**
When validation failures or hub errors occur, system creates adjuster tasks for cancelled payments. Upon task completion, rescheduling automation regenerates failed payments.


**Acceptance Criteria:**

**1. Payment Generation Triggers Correctly**
Given an active payment schedule with eligible payment dates, When system time reaches scheduled post date, Then payments generate automatically with 'Approved' status.

**2. Issuing Process Completes Successfully**
Given approved payments exist, When issuing job executes, Then outbound hub transactions are created and payment status updates to 'Issued'.

**3. Zero-Amount Payments Bypass Hub**
Given a recovery payment with amount ≤ 0, When issuing process runs, Then payment status changes to 'Issued' without hub dispatch.

**4. Financial Reconciliation Updates Correctly**
Given a payment is issued, When accumulator update executes, Then reserved amounts move to used category and balance reflects difference between scheduled and actual.

**5. Exceptions Create Adjuster Tasks**
Given validation failure during payment creation, When critical issues are detected, Then system creates 'Cancelled payments' task for adjuster review.

**Description:**

As a **Claim Adjuster**,
I want to **integrate with cash management systems to automatically calculate and establish settlement benefit amounts for life insurance claims**,
So that **benefit calculations are accurate, standardized, and efficiently managed through automated limit controls, reducing manual errors and accelerating settlement adjudication**.


**Key Capabilities:**

**1. Trigger Benefit Calculation Integration**
Upon saving coverage information for an open claim with Whole Life or Variable Universal Life policy, system initiates integration with cash management to retrieve applicable benefit amounts based on product type and coverage selection.

**2. Retrieve Product-Specific Benefit Amounts**
System obtains Accelerated Death Benefit and Death Benefit amounts for Whole Life claims, or Death Benefit only for Variable Universal Life claims, calculated without indebtedness deductions.

**3. Establish Settlement Baseline Values**
System persists retrieved benefit amounts into settlement domain attributes and displays gross amounts on user interface, accounting for proof-of-loss received dates.

**4. Create Financial Control Limits**
System establishes both single and group accumulator limits based on retrieved benefit amounts, with product-specific logic for how Accelerated Death Benefits impact Death Benefit limits.

**5. Manage Limit Adjustments Through Approval Lifecycle**
System recalculates and updates accumulator limits when settlements are approved, ensuring Death Benefit limits properly account for approved Accelerated Death Benefit payouts.

**6. Support Benefit Override Scenarios**
When gross benefit amounts are manually overridden, system re-integrates with cash management using overridden values while maintaining original accumulator limits unchanged.


**Acceptance Criteria:**

**1. Product-Appropriate Integration Execution**
Given a Whole Life claim with Accelerated or Death Benefit coverage, when coverage is saved with claim status open, then system retrieves both Accelerated Death Benefit and Death Benefit amounts. Given a Variable Universal Life claim with Death Benefit, when coverage is saved, then system retrieves only Death Benefit amount.

**2. Settlement Domain Persistence**
Given benefit amounts are successfully retrieved from cash management, when integration completes, then Accelerated Death amounts are stored in accelerated death settlement domain and Death Benefit amounts are stored in death settlement domain with gross amounts displayed on user interface.

**3. Accumulator Limit Establishment**
Given benefit amounts are retrieved and saved, when settlement domain is updated, then system creates single accumulator limits matching retrieved amounts and group accumulator limits using product-specific calculation rules for Whole Life versus Variable Universal Life.

**4. Proof-of-Loss Date Dependency**
Given proof-of-loss received date is null, when coverage is saved, then system skips benefit calculation and displays null gross amount. Given proof-of-loss date is subsequently provided, when saved, then system executes cash management integration and displays calculated gross amount.

**5. Override Recalculation Without Limit Impact**
Given gross benefit amount is manually overridden, when override is saved, then system re-integrates with cash management using overridden value for indebtedness recalculation while maintaining original accumulator limits unchanged.

**6. Approval-Driven Limit Updates**
Given Accelerated Death settlement is approved on a Whole Life claim, when Death settlement requires adjudication, then Death group accumulator limit is recalculated as sum of death benefit and accelerated death benefit amounts to account for subsequent payout adjustments.

**Description:**

As a **Claim Adjuster**,
I want to **cancel coverage for approved settlements and undo cancellations when restoration is required**,
So that **accurate financial adjustments are maintained, accumulator limits are properly restored, and payment integrity is preserved throughout the coverage lifecycle**.


**Key Capabilities:**

**1. Initiate Coverage Cancellation**
User is able to cancel approved coverage by recording mandatory business justification, triggering systematic indicator updates and financial recalculation processes.

**2. Execute Financial Unreservation**
System clears reserved amounts from individual and group accumulators, restoring available limits. When payment was already issued, system generates overpayment balance equal to gross amount.

**3. Reschedule Payment Records**
System hides approved payment allocations from operational views while maintaining backend records. Cancelled coverage is locked and excluded from policy updates and re-adjudication.

**4. Restore Cancelled Coverage**
User is able to undo cancellation, triggering eligibility re-evaluation and gross amount recalculation. System re-reserves accumulator amounts and restores payment visibility.

**5. Adjust Post-Restoration Balances**
Upon restoration, system removes overpayment balances for issued payments and updates accumulator reserved amounts based on current payment status.


**Acceptance Criteria:**

**1. Successful Coverage Cancellation**
Given approved settlement exists, When user cancels coverage with valid business reason, Then system sets cancellation indicators, clears accumulator reserves, and hides payment records from operational view.

**2. Accumulator Restoration for Pre-Payment Cancellation**
Given coverage cancelled before payment issuance, When cancellation executes, Then system restores full reserved amount to accumulator remaining limit and clears reserved balance to zero.

**3. Overpayment Balance Generation**
Given coverage cancelled after payment issuance, When cancellation executes, Then system generates overpayment balance equal to gross amount while maintaining accumulator used amounts unchanged.

**4. Successful Coverage Restoration**
Given cancelled coverage, When user undoes cancellation, Then system clears cancellation indicators, re-adjudicates eligibility, recalculates gross amount, and re-reserves accumulator limits.

**5. Payment Visibility Restoration**
Given undo cancellation executed, When payment records were previously hidden, Then system displays all approved payment records and removes overpayment balances for issued transactions.

**6. Locked Coverage Exclusion**
Given coverage is cancelled, When policy updates or claim re-adjudication processes execute, Then system excludes cancelled coverage from all calculations and propagation until restoration occurs.

User accesses open event case through overview interface. User progresses case through lifecycle transitions (open, close, reopen) with appropriate reason documentation. System enforces status-based action constraints.

**2. Case Information Maintenance**
User updates case-level attributes including reporting details, employment data, and classification. System validates changes impacting policy retrieval, eligibility determination, and coverage assignment.

**3. Multi-Claim Event Coordination**
User creates new claims across product types from event context or associates existing claims to events. System maintains relationships between event case and all dependent claims.

**4. Loss & Claim Event Editing**
User modifies loss types, loss information forms, diagnosis codes, and injury classifications after intake. System triggers refresh process cascading event-level changes through loss layer to claim wrapper layer.

**5. Party Relationship Administration**
User adds individual or organizational parties with designated roles and relationships. User associates parties at case or claim level. System maintains party records with relationship mapping to participants.

**6. Case Assignment & Special Handling**
User reassigns cases to persons or queues with supplemental documentation. User applies substatus changes based on current status matrix. System updates handler designation and tracking metadata.


**Acceptance Criteria:**

**1. Lifecycle Transition Control**
Given case status is open, when user initiates closure with required reason code and description, then system updates status to closed and restricts reopen-only actions.

**2. Cascading Update Integrity**
Given user modifies claim event information including loss types or forms, when system triggers refresh process, then event-level changes propagate to existing loss records and associated claim wrappers maintaining data consistency.

**3. Employment Data Impact Validation**
Given user updates Date of Hire or Date Last Worked, when system processes changes, then eligibility validation and policy retrieval logic reflect updated employment attributes for downstream claim processing.

**4. Party Association Management**
Given user adds party with designated roles and relationship, when associating at case or claim level, then system creates party record visible across all related claims with correct relationship mapping to participant.

**5. Multi-Claim Event Coordination**
Given user creates new claim from event case context, when selecting claim type, then system initiates claim with event references and maintains bidirectional relationship between event case and all associated claims.

**6. Status-Constrained Action Enforcement**
