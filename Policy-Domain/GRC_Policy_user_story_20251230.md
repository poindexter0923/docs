**Key Capabilities:**

**EOI Status Determination**
Upon benefit amount change, system evaluates total requested coverage against guaranteed issue threshold. When total benefit exceeds limit, EOI status sets to Pending. When within limit or decreased, status sets to NotRequired. System preserves previous status when benefit unchanged.

**Approved Amount Calculation**
When EOI status is Pending, system calculates approved amount as guaranteed issue limit minus existing active benefit. When status is NotRequired or Approved, approved amount equals requested benefit. Upon Declined or Closed decision, system retains previous approved amount.

**Pending Amount Tracking**
System automatically calculates pending amount as difference between requested benefit and approved amount, updating dynamically when either value changes through underwriting decisions or benefit adjustments.


**Acceptance Criteria:**

**EOI Status Assignment for New Business**
Given total requested benefit from new and active policies, when amount exceeds guaranteed issue threshold, then system assigns Pending status; when within threshold, then system assigns NotRequired status.

**Approved Amount for Pending EOI**
Given EOI status is Pending and guaranteed issue limit exists, when system calculates approved amount, then value equals guaranteed issue limit minus existing active coverage, with minimum of zero.

**Approved Amount for Approved EOI**
Given underwriter approves EOI decision, when system recalculates approved amount, then value equals full requested benefit amount.

**Status Preservation on Amendment**
Given benefit amount unchanged in amendment transaction, when system evaluates EOI requirements, then previous EOI status and approved amount values are retained.

**Pending Amount Accuracy**
Given approved amount is determined, when system calculates pending amount, then value equals requested benefit minus approved amount across all scenarios.

#### Feature: Process cascading member records for ported policies and handle state transitions
- **Role**: Policy Administrator
- **Action**: manage cascading cancellation workflows for ported member policies with manual intervention controls
- **Value**: I can prevent unintended automatic cancellations on ported members and maintain data integrity through supervised state transitions

**Description:**

As a **Policy Administrator**,
I want to **manage cascading cancellation workflows for ported member policies with manual intervention controls**,
So that **I can prevent unintended automatic cancellations on ported members and maintain data integrity through supervised state transitions**


**Key Capabilities:**

**1. Cancellation Event Detection and Routing**
When a cancellation transaction occurs on a master policy with manual cascading enabled, the system evaluates all ported member records against temporal qualification criteria and routes eligible members to suspension workflow instead of automatic cancellation.

**2. Temporal Eligibility Assessment**
System determines which ported members qualify for suspension by comparing ported transaction effective dates to master transaction effective dates, applying suspension strategy only when ported date precedes or equals master date.

**3. Member Suspension State Management**
For qualifying members, system creates IN_PROGRESS and SUSPENDED flags, establishes cascading flag linkage to new master revision, and publishes state transitions without executing cancellation propagation.

**4. Manual Resolution Pathways**
Upon suspension, administrator is able to invoke status-specific endpoints to either delete pending port quotes or set out-of-sequence policies to BACKED_OFF state based on member circumstances.


**Acceptance Criteria:**

**1. Automatic Cancellation Prevention**
Given manual cascading is enabled and master policy cancellation occurs, when ported member transaction effective date is on or before master effective date, then system suspends member without cascading cancellation.

**2. Suspension Flag Creation**
Given ported member qualifies for suspension, when suspension strategy executes, then system creates both IN_PROGRESS and SUSPENDED flags with linkage to master revision.

**3. Pending Quote Handling**
Given suspended member has pending port quote status, when administrator accesses manual endpoint, then system deletes quote without automatic propagation.

**4. Out-of-Sequence Resolution**
Given suspended member is in out-of-sequence state, when administrator invokes status endpoint, then system transitions member to BACKED_OFF state.

**5. Non-Qualifying Member Passthrough**
Given ported member transaction effective date is after master cancellation date, when cancellation occurs, then system bypasses suspension strategy.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**1. Authorization and Policy Status Validation**
Given performer has Policy Rewrite privilege and policy is in Issued or Cancelled status, when rewrite is initiated, then system validates request and proceeds with rewrite process. Given policy has future-dated cancellation, when rewrite is attempted, then system prevents action and returns error.

**2. Policy Cancellation and Backup**
Given eligible policy is selected, when rewrite is triggered, then system flat cancels policy and all versions, sets backed-off flag, and updates status to Term Backed Off.

**3. New Policy Number Generation**
Given performer selects new policy number option, when system creates quote image, then new policy number is assigned, endorsement forms are excluded, and operation history is not transferred.

**4. Original Policy Number Retention**
Given performer selects original policy number option, when system creates quote version, then original policy number is retained, operation history and premiums are preserved, and endorsement forms are included.

**5. Data Validation and Form Processing**
Given quote image is created, when system refreshes forms and applies decision tables, then validation errors prevent completion and are returned to performer. Given validation succeeds, then quote is set to Data Gather status.

**6. Audit and Notification**
Given rewrite completes successfully, when system finalizes transaction, then business activity monitoring messages are generated for both original policy and new quote, and performer receives new quote image for further processing.

System compares connected entity modifications (add, remove, change, replace actions) across current and future policy versions during roll-on execution to identify synchronization requirements.

**2. Non-Conflict Automatic Merging**
User is able to have consistent entity changes automatically merged and applied to Roll On Execution transaction when modifications align across versions (added pairs, removed pairs, synchronized replacements).

**3. Conflict Detection and Classification**
When incompatible changes exist, system categorizes conflicts by impact type: driver-related (unlinked drivers, mismatched vehicle associations), vehicle-related (orphaned vehicles, driver reassignments), or combined entity conflicts.

**4. Conflict Resolution Workflow**
Upon conflict detection, system presents conflicting data from both versions to user for adjudication.
    4.1 User selects appropriate resolution strategy to reconcile entity relationships
    4.2 System applies user-directed adjustments to achieve final merged version


**Acceptance Criteria:**

**1. Automatic Merge Execution**
Given non-conflicting entity changes exist across versions, When roll-on execution processes connected entities, Then system automatically merges modifications and propagates updates without user intervention.

**2. Conflict Detection Accuracy**
Given incompatible driver-vehicle relationship changes between versions, When system analyzes transactions, Then all conflict scenarios are identified and categorized by impact type before halting automated processing.

**3. User-Directed Conflict Resolution**
Given system detects conflicting entity data, When administrator reviews presented discrepancies and selects resolution strategy, Then chosen adjustments are applied to achieve synchronized policy version.

**4. Entity Relationship Integrity**

### Epic: Cascading Renewal Management

#### Feature: Cascade renewal transactions from master policy to member records
- **Role**: Policy Administrator
- **Action**: cascade renewal transactions from master policy to associated member records
- **Value**: member policies remain synchronized with master policy terms, ensuring consistency across the policy group without manual intervention

**Description:**

As a **Policy Administrator**,
I want to **cascade renewal transactions from master policy to associated member records**,
So that **member policies remain synchronized with master policy terms, ensuring consistency across the policy group without manual intervention**


**Key Capabilities:**

**Renewal Eligibility Assessment**
System identifies eligible member quotes and records for cascading based on transaction type, status, and effective date criteria relative to master policy renewal.

**Automated Change Propagation**
Upon identifying eligible members, system propagates master policy renewal changes to member variations, creating new versions for policy records or updating existing quotes.

**Status Tracking and Exception Handling**
System maintains processing flags indicating cascading progress, automatically excludes declined quotes or terminated members, and captures failure states with error details for resolution.

**Version Synchronization**
When member records require updates, system creates linked versions maintaining referential integrity between master and member policy hierarchies throughout the renewal lifecycle.


**Acceptance Criteria:**

**1. Eligible Member Identification**
Given master policy renewal is initiated, When system evaluates member records, Then only new business quotes and active records without pending conflicts are selected for cascading.

**2. Declined Quote Exclusion**
Given member quote status is customer-declined or company-declined, When cascading process evaluates the quote, Then system marks it as not-affected and excludes from renewal propagation.

**3. Effective Date Validation**
Given member termination date precedes master renewal effective date, When system assesses eligibility, Then member is marked not-affected and excluded from cascading.

**4. Successful Policy Synchronization**
Given eligible member record exists, When cascading executes, Then new member version is created with master changes applied and linkage updated.

**5. Error State Management**
Given cascading process encounters system error, When exception occurs, Then member status is marked failed with error message captured for administrator review.

#### Feature: Process out-of-sequence renewals on member records
- **Role**: Policy Administrator
- **Action**: cascade out-of-sequence renewals from master policies to member records while preserving business continuity
- **Value**: master policy changes automatically propagate to members, ensuring consistency across the policy hierarchy without manual intervention

**Description:**

As a **Policy Administrator**,
I want to **cascade out-of-sequence renewals from master policies to member records while preserving business continuity**,
So that **master policy changes automatically propagate to members, ensuring consistency across the policy hierarchy without manual intervention**.


**Key Capabilities:**

**1. Renewal Event Detection & Validation**
Upon master policy renewal issuance or roll-on completion, system identifies affected member records based on renewal effective date and validates in-force revisions for eligibility.

**2. Impact Assessment & Suspension Logic**
System evaluates member status (cancelled, ported, suspended) and applies do-not-cascade rules. When portability suspension is enabled or all changes fall under exclusion scenarios, cascading halts with appropriate status flags.

**3. Quote Preparation & Data Replication**
System removes pended quotes, generates renewal quotes with cascaded effective dates, and replicates master policy changes using defined strategies while preserving member-specific customizations.

**4. Premium Calculation & Issuance**
System calculates premiums for replicated data and issues renewal quotes. For out-of-sequence renewals, three-way comparison algorithm resolves conflicts, ignoring master link discrepancies.

**5. Failure Handling & Status Tracking**
When breaking changes, calculation failures, or issuance errors occur, system marks cascading as failed and preserves audit trail through policy flag storage states.


**Acceptance Criteria:**

**1. Successful Cascading Completion**
Given master policy renewal is issued, when member record is active and no suspension rules apply, then system creates new member renewal quote linked to master, replicates changes, calculates premium, and updates status to 'COMPLETED'.

**2. Portability Suspension Enforcement**
Given member record is ported and suspension configuration is enabled, when master renewal triggers cascading, then system sets status to 'SUSPENDED' without creating new member version or propagating changes.

**3. Effective Date Reconciliation**
Given cascaded renewal effective date precedes member effective date, when generating renewal, then system uses member effective date instead and continues cascading process with adjusted timeline.

**4. Breaking Change Failure Handling**
Given data replication encounters breaking changes, when system attempts to replicate from master, then cascading stops immediately, status updates to 'FAILED', and no premium calculation or issuance occurs.

**5. Pended Quote Cleanup**
Given member record contains pended quotes, when cascading initiates, then system deletes all pended quotes before generating new renewal quote to prevent version conflicts.

**6. Out-of-Sequence Conflict Resolution**
Given affecting revision is OOS renewal with conflicts, when three-way comparison detects only master link discrepancies, then system ignores conflict and completes auto roll-on successfully.

    2.2 If no removal occurred, system proceeds to cascading eligibility determination

**3. Cascading Decision Execution**
When subsequent renewal has member impact and no prior class/plan removal, system resets flag to COMPLETED, creates new member record version, and links to cascaded renewal. When renewal has no member impact or prior removal exists, system maintains SUSPENDED status without version creation.


**Acceptance Criteria:**

**1. Suspension Maintained for Class/Plan Removal**
Given first renewal involved class/plan removal used by member record, when subsequent renewal is processed, then system maintains SUSPENDED flag status and prevents member record version creation.

**2. Cascading Resumed for Compatible Changes**
Given first suspended renewal did NOT involve class/plan removal, when subsequent renewal impacts member record, then system resets flag to COMPLETED, creates new member record version, and establishes linkage to cascaded renewal.

**3. No-Impact Renewal Handling**
Given subsequent renewal has no impact on member record, when renewal is issued, then system maintains SUSPENDED status without creating member record version regardless of first renewal change type.
