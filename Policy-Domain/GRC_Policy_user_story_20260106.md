**Description:**

As a **Policy Administrator**,
I want to **initiate automated propagation of master policy changes to associated member records**,
So that **master policy updates are consistently applied across all member policies without manual intervention, ensuring data integrity and reducing administrative overhead**


**Key Capabilities:**

**Transaction Detection & Validation**
Upon master policy transaction execution, system validates cascading eligibility based on command type and transaction nature.

**Revision Analysis & Scoping**
System identifies new and previous revision numbers to determine affected member records scope. When rewrite transactions occur, all associated member quotes and records participate in cascading.

**Parameter Configuration**
System generates transaction references and configures cascading parameters based on transaction type (new business, rewrite, or modification), setting appropriate revision pointers.

**Cascading Job Invocation**
System initiates automated cascading job execution with configured parameters to propagate changes to identified member records and quotes.


**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Eligible Transaction Cascading**
Given a master policy transaction is created from cascading-eligible command, when system validates the transaction, then cascading process initiates with correct revision parameters.

**Rewrite Transaction Handling**
Given a rewrite transaction on master policy, when system processes the transaction, then all existing member quotes and records across all revisions are included in cascading scope.

**Non-Cascading Transaction Exclusion**
Given a master policy command that does not support cascading, when transaction is created, then system exits without initiating cascading process.

**Revision Parameter Accuracy**
Given a modification transaction, when system configures parameters, then new revision references current transaction and previous revision references prior in-force transaction.

Upon successful processing, status transitions to COMPLETED with entity state updated. If errors occur, status transitions to FAILED enabling retry operations.

**6. Status Persistence and Visibility**
System stores current status only (no history) in Policy Flag Storage with UI mapping for operational monitoring.


**Acceptance Criteria:**

**1. Successful Automated Cascading**
Given Master Policy triggers cancellation with eligible Individual Policies, When cascading executes without errors, Then all Individual Policy statuses transition CASCADING_INITIATED → IN_PROGRESS → COMPLETED and entity states reflect cancellation.

**2. Manual Intervention Workflow**
Given product configured for manual cascading, When cascading reaches manual step, Then status transitions to MANUAL, system blocks single manual flag per policy, and completion transitions status to COMPLETED.

**3. Eligibility Exclusion Handling**
Given Individual Quote ineligible for Master Amendment, When eligibility assessment occurs, Then status immediately transitions to NOT_AFFECTED and no entity state change occurs.

**4. Exception Suspension Processing**
Given ported member record during renewal cascading, When system detects ported status, Then status transitions to SUSPENDED and member record remains unchanged.

**5. Failure Recovery Mechanism**
Given cascading operation fails during IN_PROGRESS, When error detected, Then status transitions to FAILED and retry operation returns status to initial state or completes successfully.

**6. Single Status Storage Enforcement**
Given any status transition, When system persists cascading status, Then only last status value stored without change history in Policy Flag Storage.

## Initiative: Underwriting & Risk Assessment

### Epic: Evidence of Insurability (EOI) Processing

#### Feature: Calculate EOI Status Based on Benefit Amount Changes and Stacking Rules
- **Role**: Policy Underwriter
- **Action**: automatically determine Evidence of Insurability requirements based on benefit amount changes and multi-policy stacking scenarios
- **Value**: accurate risk assessment is performed while minimizing unnecessary medical underwriting for eligible applicants

**Description:**

As a **Policy Underwriter**,
I want to **automatically determine Evidence of Insurability requirements based on benefit amount changes and multi-policy stacking scenarios**,
So that **accurate risk assessment is performed while minimizing unnecessary medical underwriting for eligible applicants**


**Key Capabilities:**

**1. Sequential Underwriting Attribute Calculation**
Upon benefit amount modification, system executes three-stage calculation: EOI Status determination → Approved Amount calculation → Pending Amount derivation. Process applies distinct logic for stacking versus non-stacking policy types.
    1.1 For non-stacking scenarios: evaluate current quote benefit amount against guaranteed issue limits
    1.2 For stacking scenarios: aggregate current benefit with last active policy amounts from external stacking context

**2. EOI Status Adjudication for Stacking Policies**
When increase type equals StackingNewPolicy, system evaluates total requested amount (current benefit + last active benefit amount). If total exceeds guaranteed issue threshold, status becomes Pending; otherwise NotRequired. For amendments decreasing benefits or maintaining previous amounts, status copies from prior version.

**3. Approved Amount Determination**
Based on calculated EOI Status: Pending status sets approved amount to difference between guaranteed issue limit and stacked benefits (minimum zero); NotRequired or Approved status equates approved amount to requested benefit; Declined/Closed status retains previous approved amount.

**4. Pending Amount Finalization**
System derives pending amount as difference between total benefit amount and approved amount across all EOI status scenarios.


**Acceptance Criteria:**

**1. Stacking Context Validation**
Given a StackingNewPolicy increase type, When total requested amount (current benefit + last active stacked amount) is calculated, Then system retrieves last active IndividualStackingDetails by sequence number and aggregates amounts correctly.

**2. Threshold-Based Status Assignment**
Given total benefit amount evaluation against guaranteed issue limits, When amount exceeds threshold for stacking scenario, Then EOI Status becomes Pending; When amount is within threshold, Then status becomes NotRequired.

**3. Amendment Benefit Decrease Handling**
Given an amendment transaction with StackingNewPolicy type, When requested benefit is less than previous policy version benefit, Then system sets EOI Status to NotRequired regardless of stacking amounts.

**4. Approved Amount Dependency Logic**
Given EOI Status has been calculated, When status equals Pending, Then approved amount equals guaranteed issue minus stacked benefit (floor of zero); When status equals Declined or Closed, Then approved amount copies from previous policy version.

**5. Sequential Calculation Integrity**
Given benefit amount change triggers calculation workflow, When system prevents submission of underwriting decision, Then all three attributes (EOI Status, Approved Amount, Pending Amount) reflect consistent sequential dependencies without circular references.

**6. Non-Stacking Exclusion**
Given increase type is not StackingNewPolicy, When existing calculation rules execute, Then system applies legacy logic without external stacking context and completes underwriting attribute determination successfully.

**3. Pending Amount Derivation**
System automatically calculates pending amount as difference between total requested benefit and approved amount, representing coverage requiring underwriting review.


**Acceptance Criteria:**

**1. Stacking Policy Benefit Calculation**
Given new business transaction with stacking policy type, When total requested amount exceeds guaranteed issue limit, Then system sets EOI status to Pending and approved amount to difference between limit and existing coverage.

**2. Non-Stacking Standard Calculation**
Given transaction with non-stacking increase type, When benefit amount changes, Then system calculates EOI status and amounts using only current quote benefit and guaranteed issue amounts.

**3. Amendment Benefit Decrease Handling**

**Key Capabilities:**

**1. Occupation Code Standardization**
System maintains 60 predefined occupation classifications with multi-locale support (US, UK, Malta, Canada, Japan, Korea, Taiwan) ensuring global consistency.

**2. Risk Category Assignment**
Underwriter categorizes applicants into professional (accountant, physician), high-risk (pilot, military), public service (police, firefighter), or employment status (retired, unemployed) classifications.

**3. Temporal Validity Management**
When occupation definitions evolve, effective/expiration date controls maintain historical accuracy while introducing updated classifications.

**4. Prioritized Selection Interface**
System presents occupation codes ordered by frequency-of-use, accelerating underwriter workflow during risk intake processes.


**Acceptance Criteria:**

**1. Multi-Market Code Availability**
Given the underwriter operates in any supported region, When accessing occupation classification, Then all 60 standardized codes display in the appropriate locale language.

**2. Active Code Validation**
Given an occupation code has expiration date set, When the underwriter attempts assignment after expiration, Then the system prevents selection and suggests active alternatives.

**3. Risk Category Integrity**
Given the applicant's occupation is categorized, When underwriting rules execute, Then occupation-specific risk factors automatically apply to premium calculation and eligibility determination.

**4. Historical Consistency**
Given an occupation code was valid at policy inception, When reviewing historical cases, Then the original occupation classification remains associated with that underwriting decision.

**Key Capabilities:**

**1. Premium Sequence Initialization**
Upon policy transaction execution, system locates preceding transaction, copies premium sequences, and compares premium amounts at each level to determine processing path.

**2. New Business Processing**
When transaction type is new business or rewrite, system creates single premium sequence with unique identifier and sets all change amounts equal to calculated premium amounts.

**3. Amendment Processing**
When amendment occurs, system copies preceding sequences with updated effective dates, calculates premium changes, and creates new sequence if changes exceed zero or adjusts existing sequences if changes equal zero.

**4. Cancellation Processing**
When cancellation is issued, system copies preceding sequences, resets all premium amounts to zero, and records reset values as negative change amounts.

**5. Reinstatement Processing**
When reinstatement occurs, system reverses cancellation by converting negative change amounts to positive and restoring premium amounts to pre-cancellation state.

**6. Premium Data Availability**
Upon sequence creation or adjustment, system stores premium data in Premium Storage and makes available to Compensation and Billing domains for downstream processing.


**Acceptance Criteria:**

**1. New Business Sequence Creation**
Given new business or rewrite transaction, when premium calculation completes, then system creates single premium sequence with unique identifier and all change amounts equal premium amounts.

**2. Amendment With Premium Increase**

- **Role**: Policy Administrator
- **Action**: control master policy change propagation to ported member records based on configurable business rules
- **Value**: portability agreements are honored while maintaining flexibility to apply changes when employees return to the group

**Description:**

As a **Policy Administrator**,
I want to **control master policy change propagation to ported member records based on configurable business rules**,
So that **portability agreements are honored while maintaining flexibility to apply changes when employees return to the group**


**Key Capabilities:**

**1. Cascading Suspension Configuration**
User is able to configure product-level rules determining when master policy transactions stop propagating: either suspend all transactions after port creation date (Option 2) or suspend only transactions effective on/after port effective date (Option 1).

**2. Transaction Evaluation and Routing**
Upon initiating master policy transactions (amendment, cancellation, renewal, reinstatement, rescission, rewrite, BOR transfer), system evaluates port status and configured rules to determine cascading applicability for each member record.

**3. Conditional Cascading Execution**
When transaction effective date precedes port effective date and Option 1 is configured, system performs out-of-sequence transaction with roll-on/back-off logic and sets COMPLETED flag; otherwise, cascading is suspended with SUSPENDED flag.

**4. Pended Quote Management**
If pended port quote exists, system either deletes quote and generates new version (for qualifying transactions) or excludes quote from cascading and sets appropriate flags on in-force version.


**Acceptance Criteria:**

**1. Configuration-Based Suspension (Option 2)**
Given 'Suspend MP After Created Port' is YES, When master policy transaction is initiated after port creation date, Then no new version is generated on ported policy and SUSPENDED flag is set.

**2. Date-Based Cascading Logic (Option 1)**
Given 'Suspend MP After Created Port' is NO, When master policy amendment effective date is before port effective date, Then out-of-sequence amendment is performed with roll-on and COMPLETED flag is set.

**3. Port Effective Date Protection**
Given port effective date is on/before transaction effective date, When any master policy transaction cascades, Then system prevents version generation and sets SUSPENDED flag on ported member record.

**4. Pended Quote Deletion**
Given pended port quote exists and transaction qualifies for cascading, When cancellation/renewal/rewrite/BOR transfer is processed, Then pended quote is deleted and new issued version is created with COMPLETED flag.

**3. Retry All Failed Certificates**
User is able to restart cascading for all certificates linked to a master policy that have failed or incomplete status

**4. Handle Resolution-Dependent Outcomes**
When underlying system issues are resolved, retry process completes successfully; when issues persist, certificates retain failed status for subsequent retry attempts


**Acceptance Criteria:**

**1. Single Certificate Retry Success**
Given a certificate with failed cascading status, when administrator initiates single retry with valid certificate reference, then system re-executes cascade and updates certificate status based on outcome

**2. Bulk Certificate Retry Execution**
Given multiple certificates with failed status under one master policy, when administrator initiates retry-all with valid master reference, then system processes all failed certificates and updates their statuses

**3. Persistent Failure Handling**
Given underlying issues remain unresolved, when retry process executes, then system retains failed flag and allows subsequent retry attempts

**4. Invalid Reference Prevention**
Given missing or malformed policy references, when retry is initiated, then system prevents execution and indicates invalid reference

**Description:**

As a **Policy Administrator**,
I want to **execute authorized policy commands based on current policy state, transaction type, and assigned privileges**,
So that **only valid and permitted actions are available, reducing errors and ensuring compliance with business rules**


**Key Capabilities:**

**1. Context Evaluation Initiation**
System receives current transaction type and policy state as input parameters when user accesses policy command interface.

**2. Authorization Matrix Evaluation**
System evaluates decision table via authorization engine to determine command eligibility based on state, transaction type, and privilege requirements.

**3. Command Filtering**
System returns filtered list of available commands (endorsements, renewals, cancellations, transfers, rollbacks) matching current context.
    3.1 When policy state restricts commands, system excludes non-applicable operations.
    3.2 When transaction type is specific, system applies type-specific authorization rules.

**4. Privilege Verification**
System cross-references user privileges against command requirements to finalize authorized action set.

**5. Command Presentation**
User is able to view and execute only contextually valid and privilege-authorized commands.


**Acceptance Criteria:**

**1. Valid Context Authorization**
Given policy is in 'issued' state and transaction type is 'REWRITE', when administrator accesses commands, then system displays only commands authorized for that state-transaction combination.

**2. State-Based Command Restriction**
Given policy is in restricted state, when system evaluates authorization matrix, then commands incompatible with current state are excluded from available actions.

**3. Transaction-Specific Filtering**
Given specific transaction type requires specialized commands, when authorization evaluation occurs, then transaction-specific rules filter command availability accordingly.

**4. Privilege Enforcement**
Given user lacks required privileges for certain commands, when command list is generated, then system excludes operations exceeding user authorization level.

**5. Version Alignment**
Given decision table v2 is current version, when system evaluates authorization, then outdated state references are prevented and current state machine alignment is enforced.

#### Feature: Perform Bulk Producer Correction on Member Records
- **Role**: Policy Administrator
- **Action**: execute systematic producer assignment corrections across multiple member records
- **Value**: I can efficiently remediate producer setup errors and accommodate producer code changes across large member populations without manual individual updates

**Description:**

As a **Policy Administrator**,
I want to **execute systematic producer assignment corrections across multiple member records**,
So that **I can efficiently remediate producer setup errors and accommodate producer code changes across large member populations without manual individual updates**


**Key Capabilities:**

**Identify Correction Scope**
User analyzes operational reports to determine which member records require producer setup correction and documents each unique combination of current producer configurations requiring separate correction processes.

**Define Correction Parameters**
User specifies correction criteria including selection rules (master policy ranges with date boundaries or explicit member record lists), target producer hierarchies with premium splits, and business justification for the remediation.

**Execute Automated Processing**
System processes qualifying records through job mechanism, applying complete producer setup replacement while preserving master-policy-cascaded relationships and creating archival copies of policy transactions to maintain historical audit trails.

**Handle Record-Specific Logic**
Upon encountering new business quotes, system updates non-cascaded producers and triggers transfer activities; when processing policies without pending transactions, system archives existing versions before applying corrections across all historical transactions.

**Manage Exception Scenarios**
If declined quotes or policies with pending transactions are encountered, system bypasses those records and continues processing remaining population to prevent data integrity conflicts.

**Validate Correction Outcomes**
User reviews processing results and executes verification reports using original search criteria to confirm all qualifying member records received accurate producer setup updates.


**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Scope Identification Enforced**
Given multiple member records require correction, when user identifies unique producer setup combinations, then system requires separate correction definition for each distinct current configuration to prevent misapplication.

**Parameter Validation Applied**
Given user submits correction parameters, when target producer setup contains non-manual sources or multiple producer sets, then system prevents submission and indicates only manually-sourced single producer configurations are acceptable.

**Selective Processing Executed**
Given correction job processes member records, when encountering declined quotes or policies with pending transactions, then system skips those records without halting overall batch execution and logs exception reasons.

**Historical Preservation Guaranteed**
Given policy without pending transactions undergoes correction, when system applies new producer setup, then all existing policy transactions are archived with original producer configurations before applying changes to non-archived versions.

**Cascaded Relationships Protected**
Given member records inherit producers from master policies, when correction processing occurs, then system replaces only explicitly-assigned producers while preserving all master-policy-cascaded producer relationships intact.

**Audit Trail Established**
Given correction completes processing, when user reviews results, then system provides activity records for each modified member record enabling verification through reports matching original selection criteria.

**2. Candidate Selection and Validation**
User is able to search and select replacement producer; system validates hierarchical constraints based on position (top/middle/bottom node) against parent and child producer levels.
    2.1 When replacement producer has own hierarchy, system validates compatibility and merges upstream hierarchy members.
    2.2 If validation fails, system prevents replacement and notifies user of level requirements.

**3. Hierarchy Update and Compensation Transfer**
Upon successful replacement, system updates producer information, adjusts parent-child codes, transfers premium split values, and re-enables hierarchy modification capabilities.


**Acceptance Criteria:**

**1. Hierarchy Integrity Validation**
Given a middle-node producer replacement, When the selected producer's level violates parent or child level constraints, Then system prevents replacement and displays level requirement notification.

**2. Compensation Continuity**
Given a successful producer replacement, When the system updates the hierarchy, Then premium split values transfer from replaced producer to new producer (and merged hierarchy if applicable).

**3. Hierarchical Merge Handling**
Given replacement producer has existing upstream hierarchy, When replacement completes, Then system integrates upstream hierarchy members and updates all parent codes accordingly.

**4. Position-Specific Update Rules**
Given replacement of lowest-level producer, When hierarchy updates, Then system renames hierarchy header with new producer identity and maintains parent relationships.

I want to **execute book-of-record transfers with automated producer compensation adjustments across policy hierarchies**,
So that **I can ensure accurate commission processing and producer assignments cascade correctly from master policies to member records without manual intervention**.


**Key Capabilities:**

**1. Initiate Agency Transfer Workflow**
Authorized user initiates book-of-record transfer by specifying effective date; system retrieves active producer assignments and compensation contracts valid for that date from compensation subsystem.

**2. Configure Producer and Compensation Updates**
User modifies independent commissionable producers, compensation split recipients, and associated contracts; system validates changes in real-time through compensation subsystem integration.
    2.1 Upon removing producer, system automatically removes associated contracts
    2.2 Upon replacing producer, existing contracts persist with new producer assignment

**3. Execute Transfer Transaction**
System creates transfer quote, updates producer linkages, issues transfer transaction, and generates business activity monitoring messages; deleted pended quotes are removed.

**4. Cascade to Member Policies**
When master policy processed, system automatically cascades compensation changes to associated member quotes and policies based on configuration settings; integration triggers compensation processing command for each affected policy.


**Acceptance Criteria:**

**1. Privilege-Based Access Control**
Given user lacks compensation contract edit privilege, When initiating transfer action, Then system restricts contract modifications to view-only mode while allowing producer assignment changes.

**2. Effective Date Contract Retrieval**
Given user specifies transfer effective date, When system loads compensation data, Then only contracts active on specified date are displayed and available for modification.

**3. Real-Time Validation**
Given user modifies compensation contracts, When submitting changes, Then compensation subsystem validates data in runtime and displays errors preventing transaction completion if validation fails.

**4. Master Policy Cascading**
Given master policy undergoes transfer, When transaction completes, Then system automatically applies identical producer and compensation changes to all associated member policies unless restricted to new members only.

**5. Isolated Contract Updates**
Given only compensation contracts changed without producer modifications, When transfer executes, Then system updates compensation domain data without regenerating policy premiums or ratings.

**6. Correction Mode Enforcement**
Given transfer reason designated as correction, When user accesses configuration, Then system forces cascade to existing members by disabling the new-members-only option.

As a **Policy Administrator**,
I want to **automate attained age calculation for insured members during policy transactions and system aging events**,
So that **member demographics remain current, enabling accurate premium rating, coverage eligibility, and regulatory compliance throughout the policy lifecycle**.


**Key Capabilities:**

**1. Identify Calculation Trigger and Event Context**
System determines whether calculation is initiated by user-driven policy transaction (using transaction effective date) or scheduled aging event (using aging flag date).

**2. Retrieve In-Force Policy Revision**
System identifies active revision based on effective date and status, ensuring calculation uses correct member demographic baseline.

**3. Calculate Attained Age for All Insureds**
System applies formula (Event Date minus birthdate) to all insured members and returns updated age values for downstream processing.

**4. Enable Downstream Age-Dependent Actions**
Calculated ages trigger automatic adjustments including premium recalculation, age band changes, coverage removals, or member terminations per product rules.


**Acceptance Criteria:**

**1. Transaction-Based Calculation Accuracy**
Given a policy revision is issued, When transaction effective date is defined, Then system calculates attained age using transaction date and newly issued revision data.

**2. Aging Event Calculation Accuracy**
Given scheduled aging event occurs, When aging flag date exists, Then system calculates attained age using aging event date and current in-force revision.

**3. In-Force Revision Selection Logic**
Given multiple revisions exist, When event date is established, Then system selects largest revision with effective date ≤ event date and non-pending status.

**4. Product Eligibility Enforcement**
Given aging is disabled for product, When calculation is requested, Then system prevents calculation and returns appropriate notification.

**5. Complete Insured Population Coverage**
Given in-force revision is identified, When calculation executes, Then system processes all insured members within that revision.

**Key Capabilities:**

**1. Insured Age Recalculation**
System recalculates attained age for all insureds on affected member records at scheduled intervals

**2. Transaction Type Determination**
System applies rule-based evaluation to identify required transaction: cancellation when primary insured reaches termination age, amendment for age band transitions or dependent/spouse removals, or no change when thresholds are not met

**3. Transaction Initiation**
Upon determining transaction type, system records effective date and triggers corresponding downstream processes (member termination, coverage removal, age band adjustment, or dependent aging out workflows)

**4. No-Action Resolution**
When no age milestones are reached, system marks record as evaluated with no change status


**Acceptance Criteria:**

**1. Primary Insured Termination**
Given primary insured reaches termination age, when aging evaluation executes, then system assigns cancellation transaction and initiates member record termination workflow

**2. Age Band Transition**
Given primary insured crosses into next age band tier, when system evaluates milestones, then amendment transaction triggers age band change process with effective date

**3. Dependent Aging Out**
Given dependent child reaches maximum eligible age, when evaluation occurs, then system creates amendment transaction for child removal

**4. Multi-Insured Evaluation**
Given member record contains primary, spouse, and dependents, when aging job runs, then system independently evaluates each insured role against respective age thresholds

**5. No Milestone Reached**
Given no insureds meet age criteria, when evaluation completes, then system records no-change status without creating transactions

**4. Term-Based Renewal or Expiration**
If policy contains defined terms, system enables renewal processing including rate guarantee options. When no term exists, policy proceeds directly to expiration status.

**5. Corrective Transaction Processing**
User is able to reverse prior actions through reinstatement, rescind cancellations, remove notices or waivers, and adjust reinstatement grace periods as needed.


**Acceptance Criteria:**

**1. Standard Lifecycle Progression**
Given an active certificate policy, when administrator initiates amendments or document generation, then system processes transaction and maintains policy in active status.

**2. Out of Service Handling**
Given policy marked as Out of Service, when lifecycle evaluation occurs, then system bypasses standard processing and applies roll-on changes automatically.

**3. Term-Based Decision Logic**
Given policy approaching term end, when system evaluates renewal eligibility, then policies with terms proceed to renewal while term-less policies move to expiration.

**4. Cancellation Classification**

I want to **propagate master policy cancellation to linked member policies and quotes**,
So that **member records remain synchronized with master policy status without manual intervention**


**Key Capabilities:**

**1. Cascading Eligibility Verification**
System validates member records for cascading eligibility, excluding manually toggled records, ported policies per configuration, and records with conflicting pended quotes.

**2. Member Variation Routing**
System routes to appropriate handlers: declines new business quotes, suspends ported policies based on effective date comparison, or marks already-cancelled policies as unaffected.

**3. Cancellation Propagation**
System cancels active member policies using master cancellation reason, calculating effective date as maximum of master cancellation date and member term start date.

**4. Reinstatement and Re-Cancellation**
When member cancellation precedes master cancellation, system reinstates member policy then reissues cancellation with aligned effective date.

**5. Status Tracking**
System updates policy flag storage through lifecycle states (In_progress, Completed, Failed, Suspended, Not_affected) with master link references.

**6. Exception Handling**
Upon cascading errors, system records failure status, preserves error diagnostics, and prevents partial updates through saga pattern rollback.


**Acceptance Criteria:**

**1. Eligible Member Selection**
Given master policy cancellation initiated, When members include new business quotes without pended quotes, Then system includes only eligible members in cascading scope.

**2. Ported Policy Suspension Logic**
Given configuration suspends cascading post-port, When member policy has port transaction before master cancellation date, Then system sets suspended flag without cancelling.

**3. Pre-Cancelled Policy Handling**
Given member policy already cancelled before master cancellation date, When cascading evaluates member, Then system marks member as not_affected and retains existing cancellation.

**4. Active Policy Cancellation**
Given active member policy without prior cancellation, When cascading executes, Then system creates cancellation transaction with master cancellation reason and calculated effective date.

**5. Reinstatement Scenario**
Given member cancelled after master cancellation date, When cascading processes member, Then system reinstates original cancellation and issues new cancellation with master effective date.

**6. Failure Recovery**
Given cancellation command fails during execution, When error occurs, Then system records failed status, logs error details, and prevents incomplete policy state.
