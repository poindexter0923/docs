Calculate Total Due for the Member Record according to the following formula: Total Due = Total Billed (sum of Total Billed from all the invoices identified on Step#1) - Issued Write Offs and Balance Adjustments (as of 'Date') - Negative Adjustments that are used to pay invoice (as of 'Date'). If provided 'Date' is not equal to the Invoicing Period End Date of the last invoice, calculate Projected Due Amount for the Member Record according to the formula: Projected Due Amount = DR x number days between Date and Invoicing Period End Date of the last invoice, rounded to two digits after decimal by using rounding strategy HALF_UP. Calculate Total Billable Amount for the Member Record: Total Billable Amount = Total Paid + MR Overpayment (as of 'Date') - Total Due - Projected Due Amount."

            "evidence": "The business goal of displaying billing balances is to show the current state of the billing account or member record in numbers. Billing balances are dynamic. Billing balances change after each billing transaction (such as invoice generation/discard, payment, refund, transfer, write-off, etc.) This is in contrast to invoice balances which are calculated at the moment of invoice generation and stay unchanged thereafter. There are several ways to calculate billing balances technically. One potential way is to calculate them by means of Billing Balance Register subdomain. Another way is based on transactions. A third way is to take most recent invoice balances as a baseline and to add transactions that occurred after the invoice generation. From a business perspective, all these ways should produce the same result."
