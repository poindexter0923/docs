Strategy Rule Compliance**\nGiven a policy with 'Rate policy?' strategy rule set to 'No', When the system processes the endorsement, Then premium is copied from parent policy without invoking rating engine\n\n**3. Rating Engine Validation**\nGiven the rating engine returns zero, negative, or null premium values, When premium validation occurs, Then the system logs the policy as exception, rolls back the transaction, and continues with next policy\n\n**4. Concurrent Processing Protection**\nGiven a policy is locked by another process, When the system attempts to process the endorsement, Then the policy is logged as exception and skipped without blocking batch continuation\n\n**5. Transaction Integrity**\nGiven errors occur during business rule validation or strategy action execution, When rollback is triggered, Then only reversible activities are undone without forcing changes or invoking external interfaces\n\n**6. Business Activity Monitoring**\nGiven a policy endorsement is successfully rated and committed, When the transaction completes, Then 'Automatic Rate Quote' BAM event is created with audit trail details",

            "description": "As a **Claims Administrator**,\nI want to **classify and track claims through standardized lifecycle statuses from submission to final disposition**,\nSo that **the organization maintains consistent claim processing workflows, enables accurate reporting, and ensures proper claim resolution tracking across all personal auto insurance claims**.",
            "business_context": "- Standardizes claim lifecycle management across personal auto insurance portfolio to ensure consistent processing and reporting\n- Eliminates ambiguity in claim disposition tracking by providing comprehensive status taxonomy covering approval, denial, settlement, and administrative scenarios\n- Supports regulatory compliance and operational transparency through clear status progression from initial receipt through terminal states",
            "key_capabilities": "**1. Initial Claim Status Assignment**\nUpon claim receipt, system assigns appropriate intake status (Received, Unknown, or Pending) based on documentation completeness to establish tracking baseline.\n\n**2. Active Processing Status Management**\nUser is able to progress claims through Active status during investigation, or transition to Inactive/Suspended when temporary holds are required.\n\n**3. Approval and Payment Status Tracking**\nWhen claim is authorized, system transitions to Approved status, then tracks payment completion through Base Cover Paid or Paid-in Full statuses.\n\n**4. Denial and Rejection Status Recording**\nIf claim is rejected, system applies appropriate denial status (Disallowed, Denied, or Discontinued) based on rejection rationale and policy terms.\n\n**5. Settlement and Closure Status Finalization**\nUser is able to finalize claims through Compromised/Settled for negotiated resolutions or Closed for complete disposition, with Reopened status available when additional review is needed.\n\n**6. Administrative Status Exception Handling**\nSystem accommodates specialized scenarios including Premium Payments Suspended, Rescinded approvals, and Other status for non-standard situations.",
            "acceptance_criteria": "**1. Intake Status Assignment Validation**\nGiven a new claim is submitted, When documentation status is evaluated, Then system assigns Received, Unknown, or Pending status based on completeness rules without manual intervention.\n\n**2. Processing Status Progression Rules**\nGiven a claim in Pending status, When investigation begins, Then system transitions to Active status and prevents backward progression to intake statuses.\n\n**3. Payment Status Sequencing Control**\nGiven a claim in Approved status, When payment is processed, Then system transitions to appropriate payment status (Base Cover Paid or Paid-in Full) and prevents skipping approval stage.\n\n**4. Terminal Status Enforcement**\nGiven a claim reaches terminal status (Closed, Paid-in Full, Compromised/Settled), When user attempts status change, Then system blocks modifications except Reopened transition with proper authorization.\n\n**5. Denial Status Business Logic**\nGiven a claim is rejected, When denial reason is policy exclusion, Then system applies Disallowed status; When rejection occurs after review, Then system applies Denied status with appropriate documentation requirements.\n\n**6. Historical Status Audit Trail**\nGiven any status transition occurs, When change is recorded, Then system captures timestamp, user, previous status, and reason to maintain complete lifecycle audit trail for regulatory and operational reporting.",
