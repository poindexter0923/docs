All methods produce identical business results for cross-validation.\n\n**6.

Bill-Type Formula Application**\nGiven billing accounts of different bill types (List Bill, Individual Direct, IPA, Self-Bill), when Account Balance is calculated, then the formula correctly includes/excludes Member Record Overpayments and Unapplied amounts per bill type specifications.\n\n**3. Transaction-Triggered Recalculation**\nGiven a billing transaction (invoice generation, payment, refund, write-off, transfer), when the transaction completes, then balances are recalculated at all applicable levels (Member Record, Billing Account, Organization Customer) within system-defined latency thresholds.\n\n**4. Retroactive Adjustment Handling**\nGiven a backdated policy cancellation or amendment, when the retroactive change is processed, then previously allocated payment amounts are moved to Member Record Unapplied balance, and Account Balance reflects the unallocated state per configurable business rules.\n\n**5.
